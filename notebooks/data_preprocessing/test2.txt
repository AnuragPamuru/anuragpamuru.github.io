1212100575149445121 2019-12-31 11:57:51 -0800 <timkaine> Every year, @AnneHolton and I go to the movies between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day with family in VA and KC. 5 great movies this year: Harriet, Knives Out, Parasite, Uncut Gems, Little Women.
1212057123053424642 2019-12-31 09:05:11 -0800 <timkaine> Wishing luck to Coach Fuente and the @HokiesFB in their matchup against Kentucky in the @belkbowl today. Go Hokies!
1212034179765960704 2019-12-31 07:34:01 -0800 <timkaine> The US conducted airstrikes in Iraq over the objections of the Iraqi government. Now Iraqi protesters broke into the US Embassy. Trump’s malpractice in the region is making us less safe. Time for Congress to stop this foolish rush to war.
1211872092565585920 2019-12-30 20:49:57 -0800 <timkaine> Congratulations to @UVAFootball on a remarkable season! Same goes to @GatorsFB and @ScottforFlorida. Expect a delicious Virginia ham very soon.
1211725999768948737 2019-12-30 11:09:25 -0800 <timkaine> Friends and family know that I love reading. This year’s Christmas gift books will keep me busy for a while!  https://t.co/IZJnpWlnbl
1211684391954472960 2019-12-30 08:24:05 -0800 <timkaine> @ScottforFlorida @UVAFootball @GatorsFB @UF You’ve got a deal!
1211656441834008576 2019-12-30 06:33:01 -0800 <timkaine> I’m feeling confident about the Cavaliers in the #CapitalOneOrangeBowl tonight. Care to make a bet, @ScottforFlorida? #GoHoos
1211433316269735936 2019-12-29 15:46:24 -0800 <timkaine> This is heartbreaking news from an American hero — Anne and I are keeping Congressman Lewis and his family in our prayers.
1210617121492721664 2019-12-27 09:43:08 -0800 <timkaine> If the Trump Administration was serious about fighting corruption and bigotry abroad, they would have taken a stronger stand in support of Amb. Foote. LGBTQ rights are human rights and the US needs to call out human rights violations whenever we see them.  https://t.co/j9UFDh52jP
1209913834627948545 2019-12-25 11:08:31 -0800 <timkaine> We took Anne’s folks to their church this morning and then reprised a Holton family tradition—reading A Christmas Carol aloud. God bless us, every one!  https://t.co/qughKyqPo7
1209888971431374848 2019-12-25 09:29:44 -0800 <timkaine> I’m thinking of our servicemembers who are not able to spend the holidays with loved ones. Military families make immense sacrifices for our nation, and I’m grateful for their service.
1209860295633469441 2019-12-25 07:35:47 -0800 <timkaine> Merry Christmas! I’m grateful to celebrate with Anne and our kids this year. Wishing everyone a joyful holiday season.
1209166382480281600 2019-12-23 09:38:25 -0800 <timkaine> Senior Saudi officials continue to escape accountability for the state-sponsored murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Trump Administration should be demanding justice for the brutal killing of a journalist and VA resident instead of ignoring the CIA’s assessment of who killed him.
1208874999664087040 2019-12-22 14:20:34 -0800 <timkaine> Wishing everyone celebrating the Festival of Lights a warm and joyous holiday. Chag Sameach, Happy Hanukkah!
1207732097718222848 2019-12-19 10:39:05 -0800 <timkaine> Our bill to raise the tobacco age to 21 just passed! This is an enormous victory for the health of young people. By raising the age to buy tobacco products nationwide, we can save 223,000 lives and reduce youth tobacco use. A big step forward to improve public health.
1207008888639250432 2019-12-17 10:45:18 -0800 <timkaine> This year, one of my top priorities was addressing the dangerous conditions that I saw firsthand in military housing across Virginia—I’m thankful that my colleagues supported my provisions to tackle this issue. These reforms will go a long way towards fixing the problem.
1206708004013297664 2019-12-16 14:49:42 -0800 <timkaine> I’m thrilled that my bill to raise the tobacco age will get a vote in the House and Senate this week. This legislation will have an enormous positive impact on public health in our country—and it’s needed now more than ever as we grapple with the youth e-cigarette epidemic.
1206404399439892480 2019-12-15 18:43:17 -0800 <timkaine> So proud of @UVAMenSoccer on a fantastic season and a hard-fought game tonight. Cavaliers always in the hunt.
1205214815091863552 2019-12-12 11:56:18 -0800 <timkaine> Does the President really not have anything better to do today than attack a 16 year old?
1204874454234304512 2019-12-11 13:23:50 -0800 <timkaine> Glad the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed my bipartisan bill to prevent any U.S. president from leaving NATO without congressional approval. After 70 years, Congress sees the vitality of this alliance—no matter what Trump says or does to raise concern among our allies.
1204590699988930562 2019-12-10 18:36:17 -0800 <timkaine> The House and Senate have found consensus to end surprise medical bills that show up long after treatment AND raise the age for tobacco products to 21. This bill would prevent 223,000 premature deaths. It's a no brainer.  https://t.co/71DKfTjo64
1204563887929954304 2019-12-10 16:49:45 -0800 <timkaine> Confirmation that the President can’t treat the U.S. military like his own personal piggy bank.
1203359916112506880 2019-12-07 09:05:36 -0800 <timkaine> I’m so relieved Xiyue Wang can finally come home to his family.
1203353945801805824 2019-12-07 08:41:52 -0800 <timkaine> Today we remember all the brave Americans who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor 78 years ago, and honor the heroes who fought for us during and after the horrific attacks.
1203044204588326913 2019-12-06 12:11:04 -0800 <timkaine> I'm horrified by the multiple shootings on our military bases this week, and I'm praying for the families of the victims. We must do everything we can to support and protect those who are serving our nation.
1202754160183013376 2019-12-05 16:58:32 -0800 <timkaine> In the past few weeks, the Iranian government has killed hundreds of its own civilians. I’m horrified by the regime’s barbarous crackdown on protesters.
1202673026266877953 2019-12-05 11:36:08 -0800 <timkaine> You love to see it.  https://t.co/reEBjYMPKj
1202275559839014912 2019-12-04 09:16:45 -0800 <timkaine> While the President distracts the public with divisive rhetoric, Republicans continue to push through his extreme judicial nominees. These appointments will impact American families for generations. It’s more important than ever that we flip the Senate and White House in 2020.
1202006684534575104 2019-12-03 15:28:20 -0800 <timkaine> Yesterday at Fort Belvoir, I toured homes with unsafe mold issues that forced military families to move out and made their kids sick. It’s outrageous that servicemembers are being treated differently than other tenants. We need to pass our housing reforms now.
1201983706929356800 2019-12-03 13:57:02 -0800 <timkaine> We need to send a message to our allies that we're committed to NATO. My bipartisan bill would show that the U.S. still values an alliance that helps us battle terrorism and combat Russian aggression—despite President Trump's actions.
1200097557155856385 2019-11-28 09:02:09 -0800 <timkaine> Anne and I are visiting my parents and family in Kansas City for Thanksgiving—we have so much to be thankful for. Sending blessings today to all who are far from family, especially our troops around the world.
1199809894133719040 2019-11-27 13:59:04 -0800 <timkaine> So sorry my friend Bill Ruckelshaus passed today. A wonderful public servant, from first director of the EPA to Deputy Attorney General. He was a proud Republican who resigned rather than follow a corrupt order. America needs his example of country over party now more than ever.
1198962501334925312 2019-11-25 05:51:50 -0800 <timkaine> The latest chaos resulting from this unethical President playing politics with matters of justice and national security. Trump lacks any understanding of what makes America great.
1198657923217420288 2019-11-24 09:41:33 -0800 <timkaine> Celebrating 35 years with my amazing wife @AnneHolton! I'm grateful for all we've gotten to do together—from raising our three kids and watching them become smart, cool, passionate adults, to pushing for progress every way we can here in Virginia. Happy anniversary, Anne!  https://t.co/SNtW9PvUL9
1197165842389037057 2019-11-20 06:52:33 -0800 <timkaine> Glad to see support for making it easier to vote in VA!  https://t.co/KNgNZAS7FZ
1196953186113687552 2019-11-19 16:47:32 -0800 <timkaine> With this bill, we are sending a clear message that we strongly condemn police violence against democratic protestors in Hong Kong. The erosion of civil liberties and autonomy in Hong Kong will have negative effects on our relationship with China.
1196856513387646976 2019-11-19 10:23:23 -0800 <timkaine> Exactly what we feared would happen. Where is the Trump administration’s plan to protect against ISIS?  https://t.co/NOVUtpRmkv
1196564098458112000 2019-11-18 15:01:26 -0800 <timkaine> After historic elections this month, Virginia is poised to be the 38th and final state needed to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. This is history in the making—and it’s long overdue. I’m sponsoring a resolution to help ensure ERA ratification becomes a reality. #VAratifyERA
1196472197881090049 2019-11-18 08:56:16 -0800 <timkaine> President Trump is putting politics over public health. It’s now on Congress to succeed where Trump has failed by making policy changes that put kids’ health first — like our bipartisan legislation to raise the tobacco age to 21.  https://t.co/vGPcsz95zw
1195788544159051777 2019-11-16 11:39:40 -0800 <timkaine> I don’t want to spoil the show, but I will say that I think @TPAIN would be proud.  https://t.co/nlmeg8sqEY
1195733279111966721 2019-11-16 08:00:04 -0800 <timkaine> So much fun recording @waitwait in radiant Richmond earlier this week. It’s airing now on @wamu885 — tune in!!  https://t.co/ooZYYBdW2J
1195066275694706688 2019-11-14 11:49:38 -0800 <timkaine> My heart breaks for the Saugus High School community and for families all across the country that have been impacted by the scourge of gun violence.  We will finally have a General Assembly in Richmond that will take action to prevent gun violence — Congress must do the same.
1195032821334589441 2019-11-14 09:36:41 -0800 <timkaine> I can’t wait, wait!
1194395996173680640 2019-11-12 15:26:10 -0800 <timkaine> The President has shown what’s in his heart, and what’s in his heart is complete opposition to immigrants, including Dreamers. I hope the Supreme Court will rule in favor of these young people who believe in the promise of America. #HomeIsHere  https://t.co/eZkpHRS5Tw
1194275464803545089 2019-11-12 07:27:14 -0800 <timkaine> Trump said he’d treat Dreamers with “great heart” — and then he turned around and cruelly ended the program that protects them. As the Supreme Court hears arguments that could determine their futures, I’ll be standing with the Dreamers who call this nation home.
1193897635821670400 2019-11-11 06:25:52 -0800 <timkaine> This #VeteransDay I’m thinking of the veterans here in Virginia and across the world who have sacrificed so much to protect our country. We owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude—that starts with ensuring they have the support they need after transitioning back to civilian life.
1193243434972151808 2019-11-09 11:06:18 -0800 <timkaine> I’m grateful to the many strong Virginia Democrats who stepped forward to run for leadership roles. Your voices in the General Assembly will keep our Commonwealth moving forward.
1193243432598114304 2019-11-09 11:06:18 -0800 <timkaine> Congratulations to @EFillerCorn, the first woman to be VA Speaker of the House, to @C_Herring, the first woman and first African American to be VA House Majority Leader, and to @RipSullivan48, Democratic Caucus Chair!  https://t.co/BCvovOy16d
1192102752819630080 2019-11-06 07:33:39 -0800 <timkaine> Last night, Virginia sent a strong message of hope to America in 2020: that a president who is a bully, who is anti-science, who is me-first and me-only—that's not who America is. America is a big-hearted, can-do country that knows the value of our wonderful diversity.  https://t.co/TtKGzLSSK4
1191911606453583872 2019-11-05 18:54:06 -0800 <timkaine> Incredibly proud to be a Virginian—in a historic election, voters have shown that our Commonwealth values opportunity, safety, justice, and equality for ALL. We #TookTheMajority! Now let's get to work!
1191709381361983488 2019-11-05 05:30:32 -0800 <timkaine> Polls are open, Virginia! Today is an important day—if we #TakeTheMajority, we can accomplish so much, from taking action to combat gun violence to passing legislation to protect our environment. So gather your friends and neighbors and go vote!! ✅🇺🇸  https://t.co/B2pbOnrx5s
1191471434310340610 2019-11-04 13:45:01 -0800 <timkaine> Our planet is facing a climate crisis that worsens by the day. We should be leading this fight, not bowing out of it.
1191433995541778432 2019-11-04 11:16:14 -0800 <timkaine> Virginia has an incredible slate of Democrats on the ballot tomorrow—from Hampton Roads to the Shenandoah Valley, it’s time to #TakeTheMajority (and elect Dems at the county and local level!). Check your polling location at  https://t.co/B2pbOn9WdU and make your plan to go VOTE!
1191394501245440002 2019-11-04 08:39:18 -0800 <timkaine> My father-in-law Linwood Holton was elected governor 50 years ago today. His election ushered in one of the biggest transformations of Virginia politics in the 20th century, and I’ve drawn on the lessons of Lin’s career so many times during my own.  https://t.co/T8b5yu3iDv
1190695045868990465 2019-11-02 11:19:55 -0800 <timkaine> Let’s do this, Virginia! Together we can #TakeTheMajority on Tuesday.
1189993800644481024 2019-10-31 12:53:25 -0800 <timkaine> The @nationals incredible World Series win will be made even better by seeing @sentedcruz in this hat when he serves Texas BBQ to my team!!  https://t.co/VWePt3SI0s

1189240830776795137 2019-10-29 11:01:23 -0800 <timkaine> Virginians, if you’re planning to vote absentee in next week’s election, TODAY is the deadline to apply online for a ballot to be mailed to your home address! I voted absentee this year—don’t forget to join me and make your voice heard.  https://t.co/cyUQaDsPG2
1189198249535524866 2019-10-29 08:12:11 -0800 <timkaine> Jerry Baliles was one of the Commonwealth’s most accomplished governors of the 20th century. I’ll always remember the advice he gave, his intellect, and strong work ethic. My condolences go out to the Baliles family and all Virginians who, like me, are saddened by his passing.
1188875254543740928 2019-10-28 10:48:43 -0800 <timkaine> Kay Hagan was my Armed Services Committee colleague my first two years in the Senate. She was hardworking, kind, and dedicated to the people of North Carolina. I'm so sorry to hear of her passing, and my thoughts are with her family.
1188516947345858565 2019-10-27 11:04:56 -0800 <timkaine> I’m thinking of the 11 people who were killed in their place of worship one year ago today, and of all those who love them. We must make it clear that anti-Semitism and hate have NO place in America.  https://t.co/yF1Io8OQEl
1188470405608202243 2019-10-27 08:00:00 -0800 <timkaine> We owe immense thanks to our special forces, Kurdish allies, and all who supported the operation that killed ISIS leader al-Baghdadi.
1188255357333721089 2019-10-26 17:45:28 -0800 <timkaine> How many people can say they have a son named Nat by their side cheering the Nats on tonight??? #STAYINTHEFIGHT  https://t.co/7WeY7luHKQ
1187081353780555776 2019-10-23 12:00:24 -0800 <timkaine> Trump declared victory in Syria. But here are the facts:   -100+ ISIS prisoners have escaped. We don’t know where they are.  -Troops under Turkish command committed a war crime. -The U.S. betrayed a critical ally.  This is no victory—it’s a failure that could endanger our safety.
1187053284885852160 2019-10-23 10:08:52 -0800 <timkaine> I saw this last night at 6 pm. A horizon to horizon rainbow beginning at a baseball diamond and ending at the Washington Monument. An omen! Go Nats!  https://t.co/202z21F0JK
1186383291173101568 2019-10-21 13:46:33 -0800 <timkaine> The Senate Foreign Relations Committee should schedule hearings right away to get to the bottom of Trump's interference in foreign affairs for personal gain. It’s our Committee’s job to exercise oversight of U.S. foreign policy—we owe it to the American public.
1185227897264431111 2019-10-18 09:15:25 -0800 <timkaine> Cruelty and incompetence continue to be the hallmarks of this Administration.
1184983306078584832 2019-10-17 17:03:30 -0800 <timkaine> Trump is once again giving Erdogan exactly what he wants at the expense of American security interests.
1184962448299683840 2019-10-17 15:40:37 -0800 <timkaine> This is chilling.
1184807188965011456 2019-10-17 05:23:41 -0800 <timkaine> The son of sharecroppers, Elijah Cummings used his powerful voice to lift up those who often felt powerless. He will be missed and remembered as a tireless advocate for the poor and all who demand an honest, ethical, and fair government.
1184668584087175169 2019-10-16 20:12:55 -0800 <timkaine> Drain the swamp? No. Heat the Jacuzzi!  https://t.co/8JJk2OWRL8
1184136119018872832 2019-10-15 08:57:05 -0800 <timkaine> Atatiana Jefferson’s murder is a horrific tragedy, deepening the ongoing pain of communities of color who are seeing friends and family being killed at an alarming rate by the very systems that should be keeping them safe. We must do more to address these racial injustices.
1184119731533402112 2019-10-15 07:51:58 -0800 <timkaine> Virginia has a chance to elect a Democratic majority in our General Assembly this November for the first time in two decades - but it can only happen if we all get out and vote. Remember to check or update your voter registration on  https://t.co/B2pbOnrx5s by today’s deadline!
1182444050542026753 2019-10-10 16:53:25 -0800 <timkaine> Cheering on the @WashMystics in the final game of the @WNBA finals tonight - let's bring home DC’s first WNBA championship! Watch ESPN2 at 8pm! #TogetherDC #RunItBack
1182101564095250432 2019-10-09 18:12:29 -0800 <timkaine> Front page of tomorrow’s @nytimes... Going against the advice of our diplomats and military leaders, the President has now spurred massive instability in a conflict that desperately needs resolution. Unthinkable.  https://t.co/DCUannRlE0
1182017196756586497 2019-10-09 12:37:15 -0800 <timkaine> Right now the world is witnessing America turn our back on a key ally in the fight against ISIS. How can we expect anyone to stand by our side if they can’t count on us to do the same?
1181978903826464773 2019-10-09 10:05:05 -0800 <timkaine> Trump has left our allies at risk of being slaughtered.   He’s imperiling our gains against ISIS.  He’s putting our troops and diplomats in the region at risk.   And he’s playing right into the hands of our adversaries.  https://t.co/GyaKqSQAlP
1181671731645181955 2019-10-08 13:44:29 -0800 <timkaine> I want to wish all observing Yom Kippur an easy fast and a meaningful day.
1181659991683371008 2019-10-08 12:57:50 -0800 <timkaine> I encourage you to read these thoughts from Sen. Warner. He’s right—we cannot expect bad actors to stop interfering in our elections on their own. Congress must listen to the intelligence community and take action to protect our elections in 2020 and beyond.
1181216384585388033 2019-10-07 07:35:06 -0800 <timkaine> The Trump Doctrine continues —abandon our allies and embolden our adversaries. This is a betrayal of a key partner in our fight against ISIS.
1180878066521759744 2019-10-06 09:10:45 -0800 <timkaine> I’m deeply saddened by this news from Kansas City, the town where I grew up. I’m sending my prayers there today, and thinking of all those who have lost a loved one to senseless gun violence. Congress must take action now to make our communities safer.
1179421520176791552 2019-10-02 08:42:57 -0800 <timkaine> Wishing my colleague @SenSanders a speedy recovery.  https://t.co/BPUk8KSOBA
1179382472519356417 2019-10-02 06:07:47 -0800 <timkaine> Meanwhile, Trump encourages violence against journalists with his constant attacks on the press. He is sending a message to authoritarian leaders across the world that America will no longer stand up for our core freedoms.
1179382470657167360 2019-10-02 06:07:47 -0800 <timkaine> Why hasn’t the U.S. acted? I asked the FBI to open an investigation in July. They replied with a form letter that didn’t say whether they would. I hope the FBI is committed to getting to the bottom of the murder of a Virginia resident.
1179381919492055040 2019-10-02 06:05:36 -0800 <timkaine> One year after the Saudi government killed Jamal Khashoggi for exposing its human rights abuses, President Trump has failed to hold Saudi Arabia accountable and has undermined the very freedom of the press Jamal stood for.
1179118440545583105 2019-10-01 12:38:37 -0800 <timkaine> Two years ago in Las Vegas, 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured. Today in Washington, we’re not doing anything about it. That’s unacceptable. The Senate must vote on legislation to curb the gun violence plaguing our country. We don’t have to live—or die—like this.
1178398983217004544 2019-09-29 12:59:45 -0800 <timkaine> Wishing a happy and healthy new year to all celebrating Rosh Hashanah. L’Shanah Tovah!
1177687315193323520 2019-09-27 13:51:50 -0800 <timkaine> Military leadership must look at these disturbing statistics and determine what we can do to ensure our troops and their families receive the support they need. We all need to work together to expand access to mental health resources and better identify those in need of help.
1177384500864503808 2019-09-26 17:48:34 -0800 <timkaine> The people Trump is threatening aren't "spies" or "scum" or "animals." They are patriots.  https://t.co/62z8J8VTFu
1177219960361238534 2019-09-26 06:54:44 -0800 <timkaine> Just read the whistleblower report. Bombshell.
1176915318133813248 2019-09-25 10:44:12 -0800 <timkaine> “I would like you to do us a favor though.”  Textbook definition of quid pro quo:  https://t.co/YjaQvf3uKE
1176885110999617536 2019-09-25 08:44:10 -0800 <timkaine> The AG shouldn’t do Trump campaign research. The President shouldn’t insist a foreign leader work with his personal attorney to help his campaign. And we shouldn’t condition defense cooperation on whether or not a foreign leader will do a shady personal favor for the President.
1176885042624073729 2019-09-25 08:43:54 -0800 <timkaine> Bottom line: The Trump-Zelensky transcript is very damning.   When President Zelensky asks for US defense assistance to protect against Russia, Trump responds: “I would like you to do us a favor” and asks for help in opening investigations into the Biden family and the DNC.
1176857935638454272 2019-09-25 06:56:11 -0800 <timkaine> The House had no choice but to initiate a formal impeachment inquiry. The time for stonewalling is over — the public deserves to see the President held accountable for his actions.
1176147560924205056 2019-09-23 07:53:24 -0800 <timkaine> The people of Hong Kong deserve to have their human and political rights respected. I stand with them in their fight for freedom and justice.  https://t.co/tOcA98mYsL
1175442731289571329 2019-09-21 09:12:40 -0800 <timkaine> Our health care system needs to start listening to Black women and providing them with equal care. The Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies (CARE) Act would help address the racial disparities in maternal health. Congress should pass it—now.  https://t.co/2mkwKVs6VR
1175119349025103872 2019-09-20 11:47:40 -0800 <timkaine> Our kids are leading the way to shape the world they'll grow up in and taking action where their elected leaders won't. I'm so inspired by the young people marching here in D.C. and around the world as a part of today's #ClimateStrike — we would all do well to follow their lead!
1174110115017805825 2019-09-17 16:57:19 -0800 <timkaine> Trump tore up a diplomatic deal with Iran that even his own advisors said was working. We need to be de-escalating tensions, not barreling towards an unnecessary war in the Middle East.
1174072617419956224 2019-09-17 14:28:19 -0800 <timkaine> If the President starts a war against Iran to protect Saudi Arabia, I will immediately file a motion to force a vote on the Senate floor to end military action. Sending our troops into another war in the Middle East would be a colossal mistake.
1173361148155940865 2019-09-15 15:21:12 -0800 <timkaine> Not only was the initial investigation horribly inadequate, we now have even more evidence showing a pattern of sexually demeaning women. We need a full investigation into the credible assault allegations against Justice Kavanaugh—one that's actually designed to unveil the truth.
1173361146348236801 2019-09-15 15:21:11 -0800 <timkaine> Justice Kavanaugh said in front of the Judiciary Committee that his assault on Deborah Ramirez would have been “the talk of campus," and now we know it was. His own test for the truthfulness of the claim has been met, yet the FBI didn’t even interview corroborating witnesses.
1171792793796141057 2019-09-11 07:29:07 -0800 <timkaine> I’m in Arlington this morning where I try to come every year on #September11th to honor those we lost and salute the heroic first responders who risked their lives and health to rescue others. We will never forget their sacrifices.  https://t.co/zqg35sswRJ
1171441209274855425 2019-09-10 08:12:03 -0800 <timkaine> First Trump lied when he said Mexico would pay for his wall. Now he’s making military families pay for it instead. We’re going to vote to stop him, and Republicans should join us - if they won’t stand up for military families in their states, what will they stand up for?
1170830454569619456 2019-09-08 15:45:08 -0800 <timkaine> Background checks should be universal. There should be limits on military-style weapons and high capacity magazines. This isn't rocket science, it's common sense.
1170830362051670016 2019-09-08 15:44:45 -0800 <timkaine> The Senate is back in session tomorrow, and the first order of business must be taking action on gun violence. We haven't seriously debated gun legislation on the Senate floor in SIX years. That makes Congress bystanders — and worse, enablers.
1169713385530941440 2019-09-05 13:46:17 -0800 <timkaine> It’s outrageous that the Trump administration can’t get this right. We gave them hundreds of millions of dollars to provide loan relief to firefighters, teachers, and others who were promised it, yet they’re STILL leaving our public servants in the lurch.  https://t.co/y1MBnnPyWr
1169684433718272000 2019-09-05 11:51:15 -0800 <timkaine> Virginians, please stay as safe as you can. Check your flood risk, follow emergency guidance, and look out for your neighbors and loved ones who may be impacted by the storm.
1169348168070443013 2019-09-04 13:35:03 -0800 <timkaine> Portsmouth, VA is home to the Navy’s largest industrial facility where ships are built and repaired. One of its buildings badly needs safety upgrades, including fire protections, to keep workers safe. Trump is taking $26 million from that project to pay for his wall.
1169345535205097472 2019-09-04 13:24:35 -0800 <timkaine> In 2015, Joint Base Langley-Eustis was selected for an Air Force cyber operations squadron, investing in an industry that’s critical to our national security. Now, Trump is taking $10 million straight from that cyber facility to build his border wall.
1169340142240374785 2019-09-04 13:03:09 -0800 <timkaine> Our military uses hazmat warehouses to safely store dangerous materials, including hazardous chemicals. Trump is taking $41 million away from safety improvements for those warehouses in Norfolk and Portsmouth so he can fund his border wall.
1169025472283459586 2019-09-03 16:12:46 -0800 <timkaine> The Commander-in-Chief is raiding his own military to advance his political agenda. This is a colossal dereliction of the duty he has to our nation and our troops.
1168549241448554496 2019-09-02 08:40:24 -0800 <timkaine> Happy Labor Day! I’m thankful for every hardworking Virginian and the strong unions across the Commonwealth and country — and I stand with the labor community in the continued fight for fair pay and good benefits for all American workers.
1168252225338130433 2019-09-01 13:00:10 -0800 <timkaine> If you’re in the path of Hurricane Dorian, please stay safe. Preparedness guides like this one can help:
1167968565460291584 2019-08-31 18:13:00 -0800 <timkaine> I’m deeply saddened by the shooting in Texas. My heart is with the victims, their families, and all those impacted. Another needless act of violence while we stand by. Congress must act.
1166854162140807173 2019-08-28 16:24:46 -0800 <timkaine> It’s hard to imagine anything less patriotic than telling families serving our country overseas that their children aren’t Americans. Unbelievable.
1166031149736632326 2019-08-26 09:54:24 -0800 <timkaine> #WomensEqualityDay is a day to celebrate the progress we've made in the past 100 years and the women leading the way. But it's also a day to acknowledge that we have not achieved the true equality we strive for. And it's up to all of us—men included—to work every day until we do.
1165669599960096768 2019-08-25 09:57:44 -0800 <timkaine> A year ago today, we lost a hero – my friend and Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. We miss you, John. We will always remember your model of courage and strength.  https://t.co/NAhiTh2dtl
1165334705274871809 2019-08-24 11:46:59 -0800 <timkaine> 400 years later, it’s on each of us to understand our history and work toward a better future. We can’t do this silently or from the sidelines. Let’s honor our roots by finally living up to the American ideal that we are all created equal and deserve to live free.
1165334703664259072 2019-08-24 11:46:58 -0800 <timkaine> It is impossible to imagine an America without the courage, spirit and accomplishment of the African diaspora. This nation would be so much the poorer without our African roots.
1165334702540099584 2019-08-24 11:46:58 -0800 <timkaine> It's difficult to put this feeling into words: The Trans-Atlantic slave trade was one of the cruelest atrocities ever perpetrated by mankind. And yet, how fortunate we are that the descendants of those African slaves and all who followed are part of this nation.
1165334699159543808 2019-08-24 11:46:57 -0800 <timkaine> I'm honored to be at Fort Monroe today as we recognize the 400 years since the first Africans arrived in our country. The birth of slavery in our nation was violent, both at its start and for another 246 years. And its debilitating consequences linger in our collective soul.  https://t.co/OXqXxKH705
1164674885488013312 2019-08-22 16:05:05 -0800 <timkaine> Climate change is a global emergency. We’re watching an irreplaceable part of this earth burn to the ground, and our president thinks it’s a “hoax.” Wake up.
1164598867494445056 2019-08-22 11:03:01 -0800 <timkaine> It’s estimated that Black women in Virginia lose out on over one million dollars in their lifetime because of the wage gap. We need to address economic inequality and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, now.
1164508825421881346 2019-08-22 05:05:14 -0800 <timkaine> I’m glad to see @Hickenlooper stepping up to help us take back the Senate. He’s an innovator and problem solver whose career has been about improving Coloradans’ lives, and we sure could use him here in Congress!
1163858565213253633 2019-08-20 10:01:20 -0800 <timkaine> The Trump admin is forcing @PPFA out of Title X, threatening contraception access and health services for millions. In VA alone, Title X providers help about 50K people a year. I’ll keep fighting against this attack on women’s health—and all GOP efforts to jeopardize health care.
1162440098903941120 2019-08-16 12:04:51 -0800 <timkaine> Do you think they were laughing just to humor me? #NationalTellAJokeDay  https://t.co/rOFHIWRQOn
1162141784798978048 2019-08-15 16:19:27 -0800 <timkaine> PM Netanyahu – Drop your Muslim ban.  Congress votes over and over again to provide unprecedented security assistance to Israel. Banning any member disrespects us all.
1161808384741351425 2019-08-14 18:14:38 -0800 <timkaine> Tonight I'm praying for the injured police officers in Philadelphia. It's horrifying to see such violence against law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our safety.
1161660001288511494 2019-08-14 08:25:01 -0800 <timkaine> The people of Hong Kong are defending their civil rights, and I stand with them. Any moves by China to crush these protests would be unacceptable. Standing up for those who are oppressed is critical to ensuring a safer and more just world.
1161067861323870208 2019-08-12 17:12:04 -0800 <timkaine> “For Heather and Khalid, and all of the victims of hate crime in our country, we must and can do better.” I couldn’t agree more. This is a powerful read on today’s tragic anniversary:  https://t.co/9EJ5Kmgc5H
1160915970598174720 2019-08-12 07:08:30 -0800 <timkaine> It's on all of us to stand up against hate. The Senate should pass our bill - the Khalid Jabara-Heather Heyer NO HATE Act - to improve hate crime reporting and support victims of hate crimes. That's a start, but we've got a lot more to do.
1160915969344016389 2019-08-12 07:08:30 -0800 <timkaine> Today my heart is with Heather Heyer and state troopers Jay Cullen and Berke Bates, whose lives were unjustly cut short by this violent white supremacist rally. I'm thinking of their families and loved ones.
1160915967033004032 2019-08-12 07:08:29 -0800 <timkaine> Two years after neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, white supremacists continue to endanger our country and the President continues to embolden them.  We have to stop downplaying the threat of violent racism and fight back against the normalization of hatred and bigotry.
1160583370402869249 2019-08-11 09:06:52 -0800 <timkaine> It’s infuriating that survivors of Epstein’s sexual abuse won’t have the opportunity to confront him in court. The investigations must continue - and DOJ needs to release its findings about the outrageous sweetheart deal that denied justice to victims of a serial sexual predator.
1160580476270272512 2019-08-11 08:55:22 -0800 <timkaine> Won’t it be nice when we have a President who actually does their job instead of spending their time patrolling the internet for weirdo conspiracy theories to promote?
1160214462802092032 2019-08-10 08:40:58 -0800 <timkaine> Since then we've seen more than 2100 mass shootings. We cannot afford to wait any longer to take action and stop this madness.
1160214461946482688 2019-08-10 08:40:58 -0800 <timkaine> I can't stop thinking about how we haven't seriously debated gun safety measures on the Senate floor in more than 6 years — since April 2013, right after 20 little kids and 6 educators were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary.
1159194050508935168 2019-08-07 13:06:13 -0800 <timkaine> If you're feeling mad, sad, and worried about the state of our country, here's something: In 90 days, 100+ strong Democrats are on the ballot in Virginia and we've got a real shot at flipping the legislature. You can help make it happen, wherever you are:  https://t.co/u6whncsTKl
1158827022736474112 2019-08-06 12:47:46 -0800 <timkaine> “…just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else.”   Rest in peace, Toni Morrison. Her powerful words will continue to inspire people for generations to come.
1158107237929357313 2019-08-04 13:07:36 -0800 <timkaine> Earlier this year @SenatorDurbin and I introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to help federal law enforcement agencies detect, deter, and investigate acts of terror. We need to address the undeniable threat of the rise of white supremacy.  https://t.co/nerEGJLDUS
1158032024902541312 2019-08-04 08:08:44 -0800 <timkaine> Any President should recognize that this is a national emergency and demand Congress take action. But this President covers for the NRA and stokes hatred of immigrants and minorities. Why is he blind to the carnage?
1158032023187013634 2019-08-04 08:08:44 -0800 <timkaine> We’re still reeling from the shooting in Texas, and now we also pray for the those in Ohio who are grieving immense losses. We must take action.
1158032021333131268 2019-08-04 08:08:43 -0800 <timkaine> Dayton. El Paso. Mass shootings are a regular event in America. And so many are driven by a toxic mix of hatred and easy gun access. We must pass reasonable laws to limit access to military grade weapons and high capacity magazines—and fight the hate that leads us here.
1157758332352049152 2019-08-03 14:01:11 -0800 <timkaine> I’m praying for the city of El Paso and every person impacted by today’s shooting. And I’m demanding that we vote on gun safety legislation. We don’t have to live like this.
1156964372368916480 2019-08-01 09:26:16 -0800 <timkaine> In 1987, I said “murder is wrong in the gulag, in Afghanistan, in Soweto, in the mountains of Guatemala, in Fairfax County...and in Spring Street Penitentiary.” It’s also wrong in Penitentiary Terre Haute, where DOJ has scheduled 5 executions.  https://t.co/CwziOOU8CU
1156917399452446725 2019-08-01 06:19:37 -0800 <timkaine> I’ve so hoped to use the phrase Madame President in everyday conversation. Now I get to.
1156703100339552256 2019-07-31 16:08:04 -0800 <timkaine> Nothing says “We’re open to diplomacy” like sanctioning another country’s chief diplomat... The Trump Amateur Hour would be comical if it weren’t raising the risk of a completely unnecessary war.  https://t.co/KhDd2udecf
1156572914411401216 2019-07-31 07:30:45 -0800 <timkaine> The House has passed bills to address the gun violence that plagues our communities. They’re sitting untouched in the Senate because Majority Leader McConnell won't let us vote on them. Call his office and ask for action: (202) 224-2541  We can't just stand by.
1155977981296119809 2019-07-29 16:06:42 -0800 <timkaine> This is just the latest evidence in a continuous and alarming pattern of corruption. Every new piece of information I’ve seen shows me that Trump and his administration are NOT putting American interests first.
1154889641629274114 2019-07-26 16:02:02 -0800 <timkaine> The work @AHouseElPaso is doing is nothing short of miraculous. They've helped 150,000 people in need over the past 10 months. And they're funded solely by private donations. If you're able, I hope you'll support their critical work:  https://t.co/tMbEF1iUqR
1154889638319988736 2019-07-26 16:02:01 -0800 <timkaine> At Casa Del Refugiado, a shelter run by @AHouseElPaso for migrant and refugee families, I saw murals painted by local artists that say 'Esperanza' and 'Familia.' Hope and family - those ideas are exactly why people are putting their lives on the line to come to America.  https://t.co/stOOckBWHS
1154889631344791552 2019-07-26 16:01:59 -0800 <timkaine> We ought to be using a definition of family that includes those people — because if you define family the way I do, then family separation is still going on, all the time, on a massive scale.
1154889630363389952 2019-07-26 16:01:59 -0800 <timkaine> Another problem we heard about today: The narrow definition of family that’s used at the border is only parents and children or provable legal guardians. But to me, family is brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents.
1154889629318995974 2019-07-26 16:01:59 -0800 <timkaine> The idea that we would send people back to dangerous places to wait for asylum claims is just another example of the Trump administration’s policy of intentional cruelty.
1154889627301548032 2019-07-26 16:01:58 -0800 <timkaine> I asked a father earlier today what he wanted for his future. He broke down in tears after he told me he just didn’t want to go back to his home country, Guatemala, because of violence that made him fear for the life of his 7-year-old daughter, who he had with him.
1154834810168381442 2019-07-26 12:24:09 -0800 <timkaine> They told me that their communities at home were filled with drugs and violence, and they feared for their children's lives. So they've traveled far distances in search of a safer future for their kids.
1154834808876523521 2019-07-26 12:24:08 -0800 <timkaine> Today at the El Paso border station, I spoke with 4 families - 3 dads and 1 mom, each with children - and I heard about why they would take their children on a dangerous journey over thousands of miles, to an uncertain future.
1154753235535704065 2019-07-26 07:00:00 -0800 <timkaine> I'm about to tour the El Paso Border Station and the Clint Border Station. My goal is to talk directly with migrant families about how they've been treated and see the conditions firsthand. I'm going to do my best to share exactly what I find with all of you.
1154453926781042688 2019-07-25 11:10:39 -0800 <timkaine> I’m visiting this border station in Clint, Texas tomorrow with @maziehirono, and we will be demanding answers about these unspeakable allegations.  https://t.co/TPpdlnCy8B
1154172639281389569 2019-07-24 16:32:55 -0800 <timkaine> What. Do. They. Have. On. Him???
1154094861680807936 2019-07-24 11:23:51 -0800 <timkaine> My take on today's hearings: Grave misconduct by President Trump was detailed in Mueller's report. Now it's been detailed under oath before Congress. It cannot be swept under the rug.
1153690159646498817 2019-07-23 08:35:43 -0800 <timkaine> "He also insists — contrary to most evidence — that the Chinese are paying the import taxes."  Translation: the President is lying to you about where the burden of his trade war is really falling - on American businesses and families.
1153655160629026819 2019-07-23 06:16:38 -0800 <timkaine> After the tragic 9/11 attacks, Congress established programs to support heroic first responders and other survivors. Now those programs are running out of money. Today I'll vote to extend support—and I hope every single Senator does the same. It's just the right thing to do.
1153383740166610944 2019-07-22 12:18:07 -0800 <timkaine> Mueller's report confirmed that Russia "interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion."  Election integrity is one of the most critical issues facing our country. We must vote on legislation that will #ProtectOurElections.
1152607580545605632 2019-07-20 08:53:56 -0800 <timkaine> It’s been 50 years since the world first saw that giant leap forward — I remember my brothers and I gathering around our black and white TV to watch, knowing that it was a truly historic moment. Thankful for the men and women at @NASA inspiring us, then and now! #Apollo50th  https://t.co/hEBIkrRGPI
1151971508757155841 2019-07-18 14:46:24 -0800 <timkaine> $7.25 an hour is not a livable wage, period. No American working a full-time job should be living in poverty, but millions are. Let’s bring this bill to the Senate floor and I will proudly vote YES on a $15 minimum wage!
1151663892193566720 2019-07-17 18:24:03 -0800 <timkaine> Bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate were clear: DON'T sell weapons to Saudi Arabia—weapons that in all likelihood will be used against innocent civilians in Yemen. Trump‘s disregard for the American people's elected representatives on this issue is shameful.
1151546793223688192 2019-07-17 10:38:44 -0800 <timkaine> I just sent a letter calling on the FBI to open an investigation into the Saudi government’s brutal murder of Virginia resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Despite credible evidence of high-level Saudi involvement, the Trump administration inexplicably refuses to act.  https://t.co/UmaKALL0xc
1151473750099017728 2019-07-17 05:48:30 -0800 <timkaine> Sad news about the passing of Johnny Clegg. If you ever saw his band live, you will never forget the experience. “One (Hu)Man One Vote.”  https://t.co/BkwVApEFJh
1151211479418454016 2019-07-16 12:26:19 -0800 <timkaine> The EEOC cites “go back to where you came from” as a classic form of discrimination that violates civil rights. The President’s bigoted words are so contrary to who we are as a country that we literally have laws against them.  https://t.co/FcD1TcKcKE
1150452030562942976 2019-07-14 10:08:33 -0800 <timkaine> The President starts mass deportations today. It’s also Woody Guthrie’s birthday, who protested cruel deportations in his 1948 song, “Plane Wreck at Los Gatos.”  “Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted... They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves.”
1150406073439776768 2019-07-14 07:05:56 -0800 <timkaine> This President sits exactly at the nexus of cruelty and incompetence, and we’ve got to do everything we can to stand up against his heartless actions.  https://t.co/wWK66TlrwG
1150150328936890368 2019-07-13 14:09:41 -0800 <timkaine> #KnowYourRights - please share.
1149751697633370113 2019-07-12 11:45:40 -0800 <timkaine> Trump can’t launch a unilateral war with Iran. The House affirmed that today and a majority of Senators agree. We need to put up guardrails against unnecessary war.  https://t.co/KWzG18MEfh
1149748236187557889 2019-07-12 11:31:55 -0800 <timkaine> This visit was out of this world. 😎
1149686285445029888 2019-07-12 07:25:45 -0800 <timkaine> Acosta was never fit to serve in the Cabinet — his departure is the right thing for our country. Now it’s time to focus on finally securing justice for survivors of Epstein’s abuse and getting a Labor Secretary who will stand up for workers and trafficking victims.
1149060184691621893 2019-07-10 13:57:51 -0800 <timkaine> The young girls who survived Epstein's abuse had the right to decide for themselves whether to testify against their abuser. Acosta robbed them of that right when he kept the sweetheart deal from them.
1149033190482468864 2019-07-10 12:10:35 -0800 <timkaine> Acosta is trying to defend the indefensible. He put a monstrous predator above survivors of sexual abuse, and he’s got to go — period.
1148708777643958272 2019-07-09 14:41:29 -0800 <timkaine> I don’t feel “very badly” for a guy who cut a sweetheart deal for a serial predator. I grieve for dozens of young women who were trafficked by that predator.
1148659716626821120 2019-07-09 11:26:32 -0800 <timkaine> Shameful. Republicans in Richmond have decided preventing gun violence wasn’t even worth two full hours of debate. Virginians deserve better.
1148615835038212098 2019-07-09 08:32:09 -0800 <timkaine> The ACA has meant the difference between life and death for many across the country. Today, lawyers representing the Trump administration will argue for its entire repeal — the latest in this President's disgraceful push to sabotage health care for millions of Americans.
1148336681965277185 2019-07-08 14:02:54 -0800 <timkaine> Acosta must go. He handed a sweetheart deal to a serial sexual predator. Survivors of Epstein’s abuse have been denied their day in court for too long. I’m thankful other prosecutors stepped in to finally deliver justice.
1148326592244060160 2019-07-08 13:22:49 -0800 <timkaine> This was true when I tweeted it in 2010 and it's true today. Nine years and two more @USWNT World Cup titles later, women all across this country are still facing an unfair wage gap. It's long past time to secure equal pay for equal work—let's pass this bill and close the gap!
1148265192712810496 2019-07-08 09:18:50 -0800 <timkaine> How can we hear things like this and still refuse to make our communities safer? In the special legislative session starting tomorrow, Virginia has an opportunity to take meaningful steps to reduce gun violence. I urge our lawmakers to come together and pass commonsense reforms.
1148265191286726656 2019-07-08 09:18:49 -0800 <timkaine> An elementary school teacher in Charlottesville told me she keeps a file cabinet by her classroom door so she can knock it over to block an active shooter from entering. During lockdown drills, she stands against the door so if shots are fired, the bullets would hit her first.
1147913692450869248 2019-07-07 10:02:06 -0800 <timkaine> World champs AGAIN!! Huge congratulations to @USWNT. The USA is so proud!
1147866342609051648 2019-07-07 06:53:57 -0800 <timkaine> One more for the red, white, and blue... we’re all behind you, @USWNT!
1146767282443628545 2019-07-04 06:06:40 -0800 <timkaine> Wishing everyone across Virginia and America a happy and safe Independence Day!  https://t.co/aBTn2fV9BT
1145799864757956609 2019-07-01 14:02:30 -0800 <timkaine> @ChrisMurphyCT Glad to hear it! With the recent rise in middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, we’ve got to pass this bipartisan bill to raise the tobacco age. We can come together to protect young people’s health and address this public health crisis.
1145391181267906561 2019-06-30 10:58:32 -0800 <timkaine> In 72 hours, Trump has managed to abdicate any responsibility to address the climate crisis, pushed foreign leaders to weaken their own efforts, and, yet again, cozied up to dictators. Just another three days of the President seriously damaging our country on the world stage.
1144776370523971585 2019-06-28 18:15:30 -0800 <timkaine> After a long Friday in the Senate, it sure is great to be out in McLean with a room FULL of fired up Democrats ready to win everything from the State Senate to the school board in Virginia in 2019... And you should hear the applause when I tell them I’m @AnneHolton’s husband!!  https://t.co/vwhiyTUvtw
1144695828617007105 2019-06-28 12:55:27 -0800 <timkaine> With this President, we’ve got to put up every guardrail and check we possibly can. I am going to keep pushing Congress to do our Constitutional duty and affirm that the U.S. will NOT send our troops into war based on the whim of the President.
1144695826473791489 2019-06-28 12:55:27 -0800 <timkaine> A bipartisan majority of the Senate supported our amendment to prevent President Trump from starting an illegal war with Iran. We may not have reached the 60-vote threshold, but we’ve sent a powerful message to the White House.
1144564373198909440 2019-06-28 04:13:06 -0800 <timkaine> It’s barely 7 am, and voting has been open for two hours on my amendment with @SenatorTomUdall that prohibits war with Iran without congressional approval.  Congress should have the guts and the backbone to go on the record on any war before we order our troops into harm's way.
1144330317232312320 2019-06-27 12:43:02 -0800 <timkaine> A war with Iran would be a colossal mistake.
1144262612873568256 2019-06-27 08:14:00 -0800 <timkaine> This is an un-democratic decision. I’m disappointed the Supreme Court will allow partisan gerrymandering to continue plaguing our system. Voters should pick their leaders, not the other way around.
1143986670301339650 2019-06-26 13:57:31 -0800 <timkaine> The Constitution is clear: It's up to Congress to declare war. No president can unilaterally start a war.   Call your Senators now and tell them to vote YES on my amendment that prevents military action against Iran without approval from Congress: (202) 224-3121
1143976936022130690 2019-06-26 13:18:50 -0800 <timkaine> With this amendment, we have an opportunity to prevent President Trump from dragging us into an unnecessary war in the Middle East. The American public — including our troops, who are wondering whether they'll be sent into another dangerous war — will be watching this vote.
1143665051225792515 2019-06-25 16:39:31 -0800 <timkaine> We need to debate and vote on the issue of Iran. If we don’t take this opportunity, and we turn a blind eye to the fact that we were 10 minutes away from a war last week, the public and our troops would wonder what the hell is wrong with us — and they’d be right.
1143565747689598977 2019-06-25 10:04:55 -0800 <timkaine> Starting with our amendment to the defense bill ensuring no funds will be spent on a war with Iran unless Congress authorizes it—because that's what is required by the Constitution. It's frightening to me that a President who took an oath to uphold that document doesn't get this.
1143565746678697989 2019-06-25 10:04:55 -0800 <timkaine> Last week we were within 10 minutes of launching missile strikes against Iran.  Yesterday the President said he didn't need Congress to wage war.  I worry this President is going to start a dangerous war on his own. And I'm going to do everything I can in the Senate to stop him.
1143548714990092288 2019-06-25 08:57:14 -0800 <timkaine> President Trump told us, "We're gonna get drug prices so far lower... your head will spin."  That's not happening. Just ask Susie from Fairfax, VA, who shared her story about choosing between lifesaving care and paying her mortgage.  We need more options and lower costs!
1143327524853899265 2019-06-24 18:18:18 -0800 <timkaine> Ha! The feeling is mutual, @AnneHolton. -Your uber fan
1143319874418221057 2019-06-24 17:47:54 -0800 <timkaine> This is a lie — and shows exactly why Congress needs to debate any war with Iran.
1143274561984716806 2019-06-24 14:47:51 -0800 <timkaine> It would be a complete dereliction of duty if Congress fails to debate this. Republican leadership shouldn’t hide under their desks as our troops are left wondering whether Trump is about to send them into a new war in the Middle East.
1143231162044813318 2019-06-24 11:55:23 -0800 <timkaine> The lack of compassion from our White House is enormously frightening. We absolutely must have Congressional hearings on this Administration’s family separation policy and its treatment of detained children and families.  https://t.co/AI9VcnRzYw
1142246832841605120 2019-06-21 18:44:01 -0800 <timkaine> Israel and Saudi Arabia are standing behind US campaign against Iranian aggression. Why is this a US campaign? We don’t need Middle East oil. After two wars in the Middle East, the last thing we need is for other nations to cheer us into a third one. We need diplomacy, not war.
1142180161581924352 2019-06-21 14:19:05 -0800 <timkaine> I’m glad to be a part of @taylorswift13’s @Change petition in support of the Equality Act — nearly 400,000 folks have added their names in the fight against discrimination. Check out my response here and sign on!  https://t.co/S3iuMiVcuv
1142144168703266816 2019-06-21 11:56:04 -0800 <timkaine> Last night was too close of a call. Congress needs to do its job and pass my amendment to prevent unnecessary war with Iran. We may be the last guardrail against Trump starting a catastrophic war in the Middle East.
1141852195199037440 2019-06-20 16:35:52 -0800 <timkaine> Going to war without a vote in Congress is deeply unfair to our troops. We're going to let Trump put them in harm's way while Congress hides under our desks, unwilling to put our names behind that war? We ask a lot of our troops. Let's honor them.
1141822379863285760 2019-06-20 14:37:24 -0800 <timkaine> How could the U.S. tear up a diplomatic deal (that was working!) and then look our troops in the face and tell them, "You have to go back to the Middle East"??  That would be a catastrophic failure of American foreign policy.
1141727434179522561 2019-06-20 08:20:07 -0800 <timkaine> Endlessly proud to be married to @AnneHolton! Throughout Anne’s career, she has always put youth and families first. Can’t wait to see all she accomplishes in her newest role as interim President of @GeorgeMasonU!
1141480423144534024 2019-06-19 15:58:35 -0800 <timkaine> This would be illegal, by the way.  https://t.co/KCDzTZrbGw
1141441145291100162 2019-06-19 13:22:30 -0800 <timkaine> That's why I'm a proud co-sponsor of the Equality Act. We have a ways to go in the fight for true equality, but this is a start—and what a meaningful thing it would be to see the Equality Act passed during Pride Month. To my colleagues in the Senate: Let's get this passed!
1141441143474982912 2019-06-19 13:22:30 -0800 <timkaine> That’s what being discriminated against does to your soul. And that's what we're allowing to happen to LGBTQ Americans every day. Enabling people to seek legal recourse against discrimination is a critical part of forward progress.
1141441142099271686 2019-06-19 13:22:29 -0800 <timkaine> She said that she had worked to pull the resume out of the trash and un-crumple it. She could flatten it out to some degree. But try as she might, she couldn’t get it back to where it was before — the lines and creases from being crumpled and thrown away remained.
1141441140845154306 2019-06-19 13:22:29 -0800 <timkaine> She asked the jury to imagine her,  a University of Richmond law professor, as a paper resume with all of her accomplishments listed. She then told the jury it felt like the landlord had just crumpled her up and tossed her aside once they found out she was Black.
1141441139335213059 2019-06-19 13:22:29 -0800 <timkaine> To show the damage of discriminatory housing practices, I asked a client once to describe what it felt like to be turned down even though she later found a place. Here's what she said:
1141441138110472193 2019-06-19 13:22:28 -0800 <timkaine> Often I would be arguing in front of majority-white or, sometimes, all-white juries, and I could see that they were thinking, “Yeah it was unfortunate—but you eventually found a place to live.”
1141441136684339201 2019-06-19 13:22:28 -0800 <timkaine> One of the challenges I found in trying these cases was that, since most of my clients had found a home by the time of their trial, it was difficult for me to convince a jury that real damages had actually been inflicted.
1141441134574612480 2019-06-19 13:22:28 -0800 <timkaine> Back in the 1980s, when I was a Civil Rights attorney focused on fair housing disputes, I heard a story that helped me understand why fighting housing discrimination is so important. I want to share it with you today:
1141407867213406209 2019-06-19 11:10:16 -0800 <timkaine> When you read about this chilling UN report that details how the Saudis gruesomely and deliberately murdered Washington Post journalist and Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi, remember this: Trump knows exactly what they did, and he's still cozying up to them.
1141375010369671174 2019-06-19 08:59:42 -0800 <timkaine> It took 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation for all enslaved men and women to learn of their freedom—today we celebrate #Juneteenth and the liberty it represents, but we also acknowledge that now, 154 years later, Black Americans are still facing real barriers to freedom.
1141105931025076224 2019-06-18 15:10:29 -0800 <timkaine> Trump wants to avoid congressional oversight, and too many in the Capitol are willing to let him escape it. So as he keeps escalating this situation — this time with 1,000 more American troops — I want to reiterate, yet again: Congress has NOT authorized war with Iran.
1140970375574147074 2019-06-18 06:11:50 -0800 <timkaine> Trump had a diplomatic deal that was working to stop Iran’s nuclear program. He scrapped it.   Now he wants to go to war to stop Iran’s nuclear program instead.   Why choose war over diplomacy?
1140771662016786432 2019-06-17 17:02:13 -0800 <timkaine> I've argued in court many times that you cannot deny access to housing because of the color of someone's skin. The Civil Rights Act made that possible. It's past time we pass the Equality Act to make sure LGBTQ Americans are protected in the same way.
1140725015706591234 2019-06-17 13:56:52 -0800 <timkaine> Four years ago, a white supremacist shooter murdered nine people who were gathered in prayer in Charleston. Since then, we haven't done nearly enough to make our places of worship, schools, and neighborhoods safer. With each tragic anniversary, our inaction grows more painful.
1140653711804588032 2019-06-17 09:13:31 -0800 <timkaine> Someone tell the President that ripping health care away from 20 million Americans isn’t called a “plan,” it’s called a catastrophe.
1140302522978119680 2019-06-16 09:58:01 -0800 <timkaine> Who gains influence from our foreign policy failures? China. Who won US war against Iraq? China. Who would win a new Trump war against Iran? China. We need to focus on our chief competitor, not risk lives and waste resources with another war in the Middle East.
1140276350051373056 2019-06-16 08:14:01 -0800 <timkaine> Couldn't resist. Happy Father's Day to all the jokesters out there just trying to make their kids laugh. I've had a lot of jobs over the years, but being a dad to Nat, Woody, and Annella will always be my favorite.  https://t.co/wBNL3nOfbL
1140276341545361414 2019-06-16 08:13:59 -0800 <timkaine> When it becomes apparent!
1140276339951505408 2019-06-16 08:13:59 -0800 <timkaine> When does a joke become a dad joke?
1139283856069201921 2019-06-13 14:30:12 -0800 <timkaine> TODAY in the Senate: I introduced an amendment to our national defense bill with @SenatorTomUdall to stop Trump from going to war with Iran without Congressional approval. We need to put up a guardrail against this President, and we need to do it now.
1139256972379852800 2019-06-13 12:43:23 -0800 <timkaine> The 2001 AUMF does not authorize war with Iran. Period. Full stop.  I’ll keep doing everything I can to stop Trump from starting an unnecessary war in the Middle East.
1139167820808429568 2019-06-13 06:49:07 -0800 <timkaine> President Trump’s immorality has surpassed Richard Nixon’s.
1138834415407304704 2019-06-12 08:44:17 -0800 <timkaine> Today I'm thinking of the lives lost at Pulse 3 years ago, and of every person in this country who's lost a loved one to gun violence. I'm thinking about how they must feel when we continue to simply stand by. We *can* reduce gun violence, and we owe it to them to take action.
1138834411514994689 2019-06-12 08:44:16 -0800 <timkaine> But in 2016, I visited Pulse Nightclub in Orlando after 49 people lost their lives in another senseless mass shooting. And my fear that we wouldn’t learn from Virginia Tech and take action to prevent this kind of gun violence was affirmed.  https://t.co/AXBiBEdso3
1138834381861195776 2019-06-12 08:44:09 -0800 <timkaine> I prayed that other people in other places wouldn’t have to grapple with such heartbreak. I knew that if it happened again, then it meant we hadn't learned anything. And that’s something I couldn’t, and still can’t, accept.
1138834380259057664 2019-06-12 08:44:09 -0800 <timkaine> After the horrific shooting at Virginia Tech, I prayed that it would remain the worst mass shooting in our history. That’s a strange thing to say. But after experiencing something that painful, all I could hope was that it would be the last of its kind.
1138556735071956994 2019-06-11 14:20:53 -0800 <timkaine> Tonight is a good time to remember that @USWNT is still fighting for equal pay. That's so obviously wrong, and one way we could honor this team is by finally passing the Paycheck Fairness Act! 🇺🇸  https://t.co/JUamQMnKcM
1138545443619725322 2019-06-11 13:36:01 -0800 <timkaine> We've got legislation to: - close loopholes in the background record check system - hold gun manufacturers accountable - keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers - place responsible limits on combat-style weapons &amp; high-capacity magazines  @senatemajldr: Please. Let's vote.
1138501825500516352 2019-06-11 10:42:42 -0800 <timkaine> Wishing @USWNT the very best of luck as they get ready for their first game of #FIFAWWC today. What an exciting day for the USA as this great group of players (including three Hoos and a Dumfries native!) enters the tournament as defending champs. Let's go!
1138476153914757122 2019-06-11 09:00:41 -0800 <timkaine> Please take a moment to join the Commonwealth of Virginia in mourning the deaths and celebrating the lives of these 12 people, and to reaffirm our shared responsibility to take action to prevent gun violence.

1138476134688002048 2019-06-11 09:00:37 -0800 <timkaine> 11 of the 12 victims were employees of the city of Virginia Beach with more than 150 years of combined service to the city, and the remaining victim was a contractor who had come to the Municipal Center for business.
1138476128652447745 2019-06-11 09:00:35 -0800 <timkaine> Today @MarkWarner and I introduced a resolution honoring the 12 victims of the horrific shooting in Virginia Beach. As we mourn twelve beautiful lives, we want the country to know who these dedicated public servants, friends, and family members were. I hope you'll read this:
1138404745977257986 2019-06-11 04:16:56 -0800 <timkaine> Hey Virginia, TODAY is Election Day and polls are already open! I voted, and I hope you’ll join me in making your voice heard. You’ve got all day (until 7 PM) so double check your polling place and then go out and vote for our great Democrats:  https://t.co/UqBifNAUCb
1138206841861758976 2019-06-10 15:10:32 -0800 <timkaine> But climate change is a “hoax” that will “change back,” right?   Disregarding science is dangerous. Let’s call a vote and pass the International Climate Accountability Act, NOW!
1137149103517917191 2019-06-07 17:07:28 -0800 <timkaine> Who is Trump’s trade war really against?  https://t.co/OdaMMGNKgy
1137115731462623233 2019-06-07 14:54:51 -0800 <timkaine> There’s a whole lot weighing on our world right now, and a lot of work for all of us to do. But when you’ve had a rough week, remember there are still good tunes and good friends to light the way. Have a great weekend, everybody.  https://t.co/Rkm9SQfrx3
1137056294706307072 2019-06-07 10:58:40 -0800 <timkaine> On #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay, we should look in the mirror and ask ourselves: Will we continue to be bystanders, allowing carnage to occur all around us, taking no action to stop it? Or will we muster the backbone to improve our laws? We can and must do more.
1136809174153740289 2019-06-06 18:36:42 -0800 <timkaine> RIP Dr. John. Walk on gilded splinters!  https://t.co/1p4s59QaRy
1136658336093548546 2019-06-06 08:37:20 -0800 <timkaine> On the 75th anniversary of D-Day, I’m reminded of the good America can do in the world when we’re true to the values our country was founded on. I’m grateful for the soldiers and civilians who fought against tyranny every way they could, and I’m in awe of their bravery.  https://t.co/AUDs4TR3lB
1136627349410258951 2019-06-06 06:34:12 -0800 <timkaine> Trump knew the Saudis were working on ballistic missiles. He knew about their ongoing human rights violations. He knew about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. He knew about the disastrous war in Yemen. And he was still fine with putting nuclear technology straight into their hands??
1136426654010658818 2019-06-05 17:16:42 -0800 <timkaine> When Trump says his idiotic trade wars have "little impact" on American families... well, he clearly isn't talking to any Virginians.  https://t.co/4bs2vooGts
1136387262843891712 2019-06-05 14:40:11 -0800 <timkaine> Trump is trying to invoke emergency powers to sell billions of dollars worth of weapons to the Saudis. We can’t let that happen.  https://t.co/XdnTPV3E5e
1136262608565211136 2019-06-05 06:24:51 -0800 <timkaine> The House is passing commonsense measures to reduce gun violence. Republican leadership in the Senate refuses to let us consider them.   Meanwhile, the carnage continues across our nation.  We need to wake up.  https://t.co/vBUt2lWrxa
1136081089473261570 2019-06-04 18:23:33 -0800 <timkaine> So on this 100th anniversary, let’s acknowledge that we’ve got a lot of work left to do. We — elected officials, fired up citizens, parents, everyone! — have got to keep fighting for complete equality for women in schools, in workplaces, in government, and at the ballot box. 3/3
1136081086776303617 2019-06-04 18:23:33 -0800 <timkaine> Women face attacks on health care access from this Administration and state governments every day. Sexual harassment is a problem we’re only starting to understand the magnitude of. We’re woefully behind when it comes to electing women to office. Voter suppression is rampant. 2/
1136081084167479296 2019-06-04 18:23:32 -0800 <timkaine> 100 years ago today Congress passed the 19th Amendment to grant women the right to vote. Today, we celebrate that milestone and our progress as a nation, even as we continue to push for full and true equality for women across the country and globe. We're not there yet. 1/
1135965091273330688 2019-06-04 10:42:37 -0800 <timkaine> Why is President Trump so eager to give the Saudis exactly what they want, when they want it?? I have serious, serious concerns.
1135929920591454214 2019-06-04 08:22:52 -0800 <timkaine> There’s a lot of unfinished business to make our communities safer. We need more than thoughts and prayers; we need action.
1135929918972465152 2019-06-04 08:22:51 -0800 <timkaine> When I was Governor following the tragedy at Virginia Tech, we made some progress to fix a flaw in the background record check system that allowed the shooter to purchase a weapon, but when we tried to do more to strengthen background checks, Republicans blocked our efforts.
1135929917303140352 2019-06-04 08:22:51 -0800 <timkaine> It’s painfully clear from the horrific shooting in Virginia Beach and the daily scourge of gun violence in communities across the Commonwealth that Virginia must pass commonsense gun safety reforms.
1135929914392293376 2019-06-04 08:22:50 -0800 <timkaine> I applaud @GovernorVA, who has seen the carnage of gun violence as a pediatrician, for calling the General Assembly to gather in a special session to find solutions.
1134619291490365441 2019-05-31 17:34:53 -0800 <timkaine> As we mourn this tragedy in our Commonwealth, I want Virginians to know that I will keep pushing for Congress to take action to prevent the daily scourge of gun violence in America.
1134598280547930113 2019-05-31 16:11:24 -0800 <timkaine> I’m devastated to learn of the tragic shooting tonight in Virginia Beach. My heart is with everyone who lost a loved one, and I’m praying for a swift recovery for all those who have been injured.
1134191152603832320 2019-05-30 13:13:37 -0800 <timkaine> My best advice for all the bright kids competing in tonight’s #SpellingBee: When in doubt, a joke always calms the nerves. Good luck to all of you — I’m still dining out on my 2013 Press Club Bee victory!  https://t.co/ewJHMHEBml
1133931841898127360 2019-05-29 20:03:13 -0800 <timkaine> This is pathetic.
1133792068776677378 2019-05-29 10:47:48 -0800 <timkaine> Bob Mueller's report detailed how President Trump has obstructed justice. The only reason he wasn’t charged is that Mueller doesn’t believe you can prosecute a sitting president.   Bottom line: The level of corruption coming from the Trump White House should alarm all Americans.
1133052817445412864 2019-05-27 09:50:17 -0800 <timkaine> Grateful for the men and women who have served this country and given the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. Thinking of them today and every day.
1133015378454560769 2019-05-27 07:21:31 -0800 <timkaine> Happy Memorial Day!  https://t.co/WqleYp6Plj
1132429456956641280 2019-05-25 16:33:16 -0800 <timkaine> @CoryBooker Not too shabby.
1132027907243728897 2019-05-24 13:57:39 -0800 <timkaine> President Trump is bypassing Congress to arm the Saudis. He turns a blind eye to Khashoggi murder, imprisonment of women’s rights activists, botched war in Yemen. Approves secret transfers of nuclear know-how, and now this.  What do they have on him?  https://t.co/m4AHgjnpeb
1131944537214148608 2019-05-24 08:26:22 -0800 <timkaine> Anne and I started Memorial Day weekend right by attending the commissioning of 11 new Navy and Marine officers at Jefferson Memorial.  Congratulations to all who commissioned this spring!  https://t.co/RRPMOGwQGe
1130876404021846017 2019-05-21 09:42:00 -0800 <timkaine> Compassionate leaders work to expand health care, education, and access to contraception. They don't work to criminalize women and doctors for making safe and legal choices. #StopTheBans
1130585963649019904 2019-05-20 14:27:53 -0800 <timkaine> In just one year, the number of young people using e-cigarettes increased by 1.5 MILLION. We need to raise the tobacco age to 21.  https://t.co/rDbg9ehepT
1128635839007924224 2019-05-15 05:18:47 -0800 <timkaine> Alabama’s extreme and unconstitutional ban on abortions—even for victims of rape and incest—is the latest GOP demonstration of contempt for women. They’ve bitterly opposed wider access to health care and contraception, preferring to criminalize women and doctors. Unconscionable!
1128452215675527168 2019-05-14 17:09:08 -0800 <timkaine> I’ll be on @allinwithchris in a few minutes talking to @chrislhayes about Trump’s dangerous actions that I fear are leading us straight to an unnecessary war in the Middle East. I hope you’ll watch.
1128409889292869632 2019-05-14 14:20:57 -0800 <timkaine> Trump thinks our troops are toy soldiers he can just move around—but these are real men and women whose lives are at stake. Many are in my state. I've got a kid in the military. And I will do anything I can to stop this President from getting us into a war we should not be in.
1128349286431899648 2019-05-14 10:20:08 -0800 <timkaine> Remember Iraq? A President told America that we had to go into war because Iraq had nuclear weapons.   Now look at Iran: We had a diplomatic deal that was working. President Trump broke the deal, and now he's saying we could wage war against them?   This is the height of idiocy.
1128105458630311936 2019-05-13 18:11:15 -0800 <timkaine> With the U.S. breaking the deal with Iran, is it any wonder that the North Korea negotiation is going nowhere?  How many wars will Trump blunder our country into??
1128105456512245765 2019-05-13 18:11:14 -0800 <timkaine> This is complete madness.   Trump cancels a diplomatic deal with Iran—against the advice of Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis, European allies, the International Atomic Energy Agency—and now has drawn up plans to send 120,000 American troops into a new war in the Middle East.
1127599973871378432 2019-05-12 08:42:38 -0800 <timkaine> Lucky to have great moms in my life! Today I’m thinking of my mom Kathy, who helps me stay optimistic, my wife Anne, a great public servant and wonderful mother to our 3 kids, and my mother-in-law Jinks who has lived more energetically than anyone I know. #HappyMothersDay to all!  https://t.co/3oeDt9FzJw
1126496042919321600 2019-05-09 07:36:00 -0800 <timkaine> It’s about time. When I was Virginia’s Lieutenant Governor, I championed legislation to require all clergy to report sexual abuse. Sadly, some in my Church helped defeat the legislation.  https://t.co/OqkTBpUgL1
1126188793801916418 2019-05-08 11:15:06 -0800 <timkaine> Donald Trump is taking steps that I fear are leading us to an unnecessary war with Iran. That chills my blood. Let me be clear: I am going to do anything I can to stop him from sidestepping Congress to start an illegal war.
1125893254547935234 2019-05-07 15:40:44 -0800 <timkaine> Keeping families together shouldn’t be partisan. Protecting innocent kids shouldn’t be partisan. We should pass the REUNITE Act in the Senate and try to bring these families back together.
1125893252673097731 2019-05-07 15:40:44 -0800 <timkaine> One year after the Trump Administration announced its policy to separate families at the border, countless kids are still separated from their parents. The Administration isn't doing enough to reunite them—it doesn't even know how many kids are out there. This is inhumane.
1125814283798024197 2019-05-07 10:26:56 -0800 <timkaine> On #TeacherAppreciationDay, we thank our educators for the important work they do. But let's do more—let's honor their tireless work by committing to pay teachers more. No teacher should be forced to leave the work they love because they can’t support their family!
1125725771652374528 2019-05-07 04:35:13 -0800 <timkaine> For the record, spinning a global disaster into “new opportunities for trade” is not exactly what I meant when I said we need to take action.
1125425497842823174 2019-05-06 08:42:02 -0800 <timkaine> We need to enact planet-saving policy at a large scale — I’m committed to doing everything I can in the Senate. But there’s more we can do at home, too. The @NRDC has a few concrete actions we can all take to make a difference:  https://t.co/xZW1OgzKaf
1125425495842144256 2019-05-06 08:42:02 -0800 <timkaine> We need to take action now. Not tomorrow, not after 2020. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and defending critically endangered wildlife has to be a priority in the US and across the world. Because this is the only world we’ve got.  https://t.co/B3x8muGlls
1125204283270598658 2019-05-05 18:03:01 -0800 <timkaine> I wish the Muslim community across Virginia and the globe a blessed Ramadan. May everyone reflecting feel peace and joy. Ramadan Kareem!
1125192114785136640 2019-05-05 17:14:39 -0800 <timkaine> There is nothing that shows more clearly that this President disrespects the Constitution than the refusal of his Secretary of State to acknowledge that Congress must authorize wars.    No wars unless the people’s elected legislature votes to initiate!  https://t.co/H4HvAf9IKG
1125108770282057730 2019-05-05 11:43:29 -0800 <timkaine> The utter devastation of the civil war in Yemen continues. By the end of the year we will have lost 140,000 children under the age of 5. Yet the President refuses to end U.S. involvement.
1124453970355920897 2019-05-03 16:21:32 -0800 <timkaine> Came across this great old pic today. I miss this guy!!  https://t.co/TuxSB53AO2
1124390704627822592 2019-05-03 12:10:08 -0800 <timkaine> Another normal day with our President.  https://t.co/7VtUaDUl4V
1124369111017033728 2019-05-03 10:44:20 -0800 <timkaine> The American people deserve to hear directly from Robert Mueller about his conclusions. After the blatant mischaracterizations by AG Barr, it's critical that Mueller testify publicly so we set the record straight. Sign my petition if you agree:  https://t.co/Itrgx5paGV
1124010592086450178 2019-05-02 10:59:42 -0800 <timkaine> The Trump Administration still hasn’t given us details of the secret transfers of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.   There’s something they don’t want us to see.
1123979413274734592 2019-05-02 08:55:49 -0800 <timkaine> We need 67 votes today to override Trump’s veto of our resolution to end involvement in Yemen’s civil war. Call your Senators and tell them a vote against overriding says they’re okay with Trump deferring to Saudi Arabia over the American people’s representatives. 202-224-3121.
1123969246629904384 2019-05-02 08:15:25 -0800 <timkaine> The President wants to take health care away from more than 20 million Americans. That sentence never gets any less horrifying.  https://t.co/PVcei2Vc4K
1123729447046324226 2019-05-01 16:22:32 -0800 <timkaine> Today, as we remember the 6 million Jews who were killed during the Holocaust, we also recommit ourselves to fighting anti-Semitism and intolerance in all its forms, in every community, every day. Such violence and hate are in our history, but they must not be part of our future.
1123681711504666624 2019-05-01 13:12:51 -0800 <timkaine> I went to the border and talked with some of the many Venezuelans who are crossing into Colombia every day—mothers with young children, pregnant women, working people—they're leaving everything they know, fleeing an authoritarian government, to find peace and freedom.
1123681709252337666 2019-05-01 13:12:51 -0800 <timkaine> Juan Guaidó is the legitimate interim president of Venezuela. The U.S. stands with the people of Venezuela, and we've got to support them through humanitarian aid, diplomatic efforts, and sanctions on the Maduro regime.
1123615652487606273 2019-05-01 08:50:21 -0800 <timkaine> The fact is, Barr is acting like Donald Trump’s defense lawyer or a TV commentator rather than the Attorney General of the United States.
1123615562649751554 2019-05-01 08:50:00 -0800 <timkaine> I voted against Barr to be Attorney General. I had him in my office, looked him in the eye, and asked him questions - and I was convinced he would not be a straight shooter if he was AG. I knew he should not be in this post, and this has proven it.
1123615383141933056 2019-05-01 08:49:17 -0800 <timkaine> Look, I read AG Barr’s four page summary.   And then I read the Mueller report.  The four page summary was a political spin job. It doesn’t even make an *attempt* to accurately characterize the four hundred page report and the severe misconduct it found!
1123305069305303044 2019-04-30 12:16:13 -0800 <timkaine> We’ve been pushing back hard against the Administration’s mind-boggling plans to scrap the USS Truman. Glad to see they listened and will reverse course.
1123288863852650496 2019-04-30 11:11:49 -0800 <timkaine> I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: strong men support strong women!   So @CecileRichards, @aliciagarza, @aijenpoo - deal me in.    https://t.co/Vs9U4esDge  https://t.co/Qo5jQjcMfX
1123258920607334400 2019-04-30 09:12:50 -0800 <timkaine> Earlier this year, Virginia’s attempt to be the 38th and final state needed to ratify the ERA failed by just ONE vote. If we flip the General Assembly in November (and we’re close!!), we could finally see the Equal Rights Amendment become a reality.  https://t.co/qeNiG3y7pn
1122301315927900167 2019-04-27 17:47:39 -0800 <timkaine> I am heartsick hearing of the shooting at Chabad of Poway—an act of violence in a place of worship on this meaningful day is horrifying. Gun violence continues to plague our country in frightening ways every single day. My heart is with Poway and the Jewish community tonight.
1122120805595406336 2019-04-27 05:50:22 -0800 <timkaine> UVA b-ball is built on 5 pillars: Humility, Passion, Unity, Servanthood, Thankfulness.   Trump has 3 pillars: I, Me, Mine.   Good call Hoos!   https://t.co/4tK6MI0X9c
1121513736781672449 2019-04-25 13:38:06 -0800 <timkaine> Got an early start this morning to talk to folks around VA... On the itinerary: Fishersville, Wytheville, and Wise County today, Lebanon, Abingdon, Pulaski, and Blacksburg tomorrow, and Charlottesville Saturday! Glad to be on the road - and yes I’m taking music suggestions... 😎
1121073667998408704 2019-04-24 08:29:25 -0800 <timkaine> Thrilled that VA’s own @RodRobinsonRVA has been named National Teacher of the Year! Rodney teaches social studies at Richmond’s juvenile detention center, and is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline. Congratulations on this much-deserved honor, Rodney!  https://t.co/jteII6pmHq
1119987563907907585 2019-04-21 08:33:38 -0800 <timkaine> I am horrified by the attacks across Sri Lanka. Targeting innocent people, including in places of worship on Easter Sunday, is an act of true evil. We must stand together all over the world in the face of hate. My heart goes out to all Sri Lankans.
1119967944455393282 2019-04-21 07:15:40 -0800 <timkaine> The beautiful Notre-Dame Cathedral in Ho Chi Minh City before this morning’s Easter Mass.   “And He Shall Reign Forever and Ever!”  https://t.co/a3gz2FMEjw
1119593899520032768 2019-04-20 06:29:21 -0800 <timkaine> 🎵 I roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts And all around me, a voice was sounding This land was made for you and me!  Happy #NationalParkWeek. Let’s get out from behind our screens and enjoy this beautiful land we call home!  https://t.co/FK3H9GJcA5
1119321553202708487 2019-04-19 12:27:08 -0800 <timkaine> What a joyous weekend for so many of us celebrating holidays across Virginia and around the world! I wish everyone who is celebrating tonight a happy Passover. Chag Sameach!
1119050911404449793 2019-04-18 18:31:42 -0800 <timkaine> Robert Mueller *must* testify to Congress so the American public can hear an honest and unbiased account of the findings of his investigation.
1118691249320550400 2019-04-17 18:42:32 -0800 <timkaine> Terry has been a great friend and a strong leader for Virginia over the years. And as we all know, he’s a whole lot of fun. I’ll be glad to have him by my side hitting the trail for VA Dems this year!  Terry, just one request: Leave the Hawaiian shirt at home.
1118192140348219392 2019-04-16 09:39:15 -0800 <timkaine> Austin, Brian, Caitlin, Daniel, Daniel, Emily, Erin, G.V., Henry, Jamie, Jarrett, Jeremy, Jocelyne, Juan, Julia, Kevin, Lauren, Leslie, Liviu, Mary, Matthew, Matthew, Maxine, Michael, Minal, Nicole, Partahi, Rachael, Reema, Ross, Ryan, Waleed.  Today and all days we remember you.
1117888637926920192 2019-04-15 13:33:15 -0800 <timkaine> Notre Dame has been a center of faith, beauty, and history for more than 800 years. To watch a place beloved by so many around the world burn is tragic. I'm sending prayers to all Parisians, and indeed the global community, as we mourn this loss and begin to rebuild.
1117188921203527680 2019-04-13 15:12:49 -0800 <timkaine> Politicizing footage of a terrorist attack against the US in which thousands lost their lives is beyond disgraceful. It’s an insult to everyone who lost a loved one on 9/11, and it’s another attempt to sow hatred against the Muslim community. The President should be ashamed.
1116102283371188227 2019-04-10 15:14:55 -0800 <timkaine> And that’s exactly what we did —&gt; Today we introduced legislation to require Congressional review of nuclear information transfers — there should NOT be secret deals that send nuclear know-how to countries that potentially aspire to develop nuclear bombs!
1115706851004485635 2019-04-09 13:03:36 -0800 <timkaine> Who would have believed this? Instead of the US joining with Europe to pressure China on trade, President Trump’s actions are pushing Europe and China together.  https://t.co/zmrKvGpfci
1115680172903227393 2019-04-09 11:17:36 -0800 <timkaine> I also introduced the Child Welfare Workforce Support Act. The physical and emotional challenges inherent in child welfare work (not to mention relatively low compensation) make these careers difficult to sustain—we can and should work to better support these workers!
1115680171040956418 2019-04-09 11:17:35 -0800 <timkaine> LGBTQ youth are nearly 4 times more likely to experience childhood sexual abuse than their heterosexual peers.   That’s unacceptable.   Today @SenatorBaldwin &amp; I introduced the Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act—we must do more to both prevent abuse and help those recovering from trauma.
1115461705860042752 2019-04-08 20:49:29 -0800 <timkaine> NATIONAL CHAMPS!! So proud of @UVAMensHoops and Coach Bennett!
1114682347314733056 2019-04-06 17:12:36 -0800 <timkaine> Wahoowa! Look Hoos going to the national championship!
1114570195140599809 2019-04-06 09:46:56 -0800 <timkaine> We need to do more to bring home the Americans wrongly detained in Iran.   https://t.co/urylArIWQ4
1114516986040659969 2019-04-06 06:15:30 -0800 <timkaine> And my final question: Who in the US is benefiting from all this?  I’m going to keep pushing until we get answers to these questions.  13/13
1114516985126293504 2019-04-06 06:15:30 -0800 <timkaine> All of this leads me to ask: Why should we help Saudi Arabia in a disastrous war in Yemen? Why do we turn a blind eye to Saudi human rights abuses? Why would we transfer nuclear know-how and plot for a deal with Saudi Arabia, possibly sparking an arms race in the Middle East? 12/
1114516983851175938 2019-04-06 06:15:30 -0800 <timkaine> And additional reporting connects disgraced National Security Advisor Michael Flynn—convicted for lying about his ties and communications with foreign governments—to the push for a Saudi nuclear deal. 11/  https://t.co/FQsl9ZiGKa
1114516982886490113 2019-04-06 06:15:30 -0800 <timkaine> Remember, Jared Kushner was initially denied a security clearance in the White House due to concerns about foreign influence and personal financial conflicts. 10/
1114516981439442944 2019-04-06 06:15:29 -0800 <timkaine> And beyond just the timing—who is getting these secret approvals? One major nuclear firm, Westinghouse, is owned by the same investors who bailed Jared Kushner out of a bad real estate deal. 9/  https://t.co/K0eZL1PZ5B
1114516980583870465 2019-04-06 06:15:29 -0800 <timkaine> In a hearing last week, I specifically asked Secretary Perry whether the secret approvals of nuclear information transfer occurred before or after the October 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. He claimed not to know. 8/
1114516979552063489 2019-04-06 06:15:29 -0800 <timkaine> We know that Saudi Arabia is intent on building a nuclear program—but they haven’t agreed to the non-proliferation rules that would prevent the development of nuclear weapons. So it's only logical that Congress wants to know more about these approvals. 7/
1114516978520268800 2019-04-06 06:15:29 -0800 <timkaine> Then last week, we learned that the Trump administration has approved *secret transfers of nuclear technical information* from American companies to Saudi Arabia on 7 occasions. These transfers have been public in the past. Why are they secret now? When did they happen? 6/
1114516976980963328 2019-04-06 06:15:28 -0800 <timkaine> You would think the US would be up in arms about these horrors. But the Trump administration won’t stand up to Saudi Arabia. The President refuses to even submit a report determining whether or not Khashoggi's murder was a human rights violation. 5/  https://t.co/16p4JTjUHZ
1114516976100155392 2019-04-06 06:15:28 -0800 <timkaine> In addition to the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi Arabia has been arresting civil rights activists—including Virginia residents Salah al-Haider and his mother Aziza al-Youssef—simply for advocating for women’s rights! 4/
1114516975160627205 2019-04-06 06:15:28 -0800 <timkaine> Virginia resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi criticized Saudi policy in Yemen. For his advocacy against the war, the government of Saudi Arabia lured him into their consulate in Istanbul and then tortured and assassinated him, dismembering his body with a bone saw. 3/
1114516974082711552 2019-04-06 06:15:28 -0800 <timkaine> The Yemen Civil War has been a humanitarian disaster, and Saudi intervention has made it worse. The US should NOT be involved. 2/  https://t.co/ziFw93lsGY
1114516968390918144 2019-04-06 06:15:26 -0800 <timkaine> This week, the House passed a Senate resolution ordering the President to stop US military support for Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen’s Civil War. The bill now goes to the WH where Trump is likely to veto—then Congress would need to vote to override. So what’s at stake? 1/
1114171743722196993 2019-04-05 07:23:38 -0800 <timkaine> Salah al-Haidar—a Virginia resident and son of women’s rights activist Aziza al-Youssef—has been arrested by Saudi Arabia. This is the latest in Saudi Arabia’s appalling human rights violations, yet the Trump administration continues to turn a blind eye.  https://t.co/BNJXcS0MOA
1113831113225646082 2019-04-04 08:50:06 -0800 <timkaine> UPDATE: The House just passed this resolution to end U.S. involvement in Yemen.  I strongly urge the President to sign it as quickly as possible. It's an unauthorized war—and it's causing utter devastation for millions of innocent people.
1113783741485408256 2019-04-04 05:41:51 -0800 <timkaine> .@MichaelBennet is a public servant I admire and one of my closest friends in the Senate. Wishing him and his family well.
1113518557495746560 2019-04-03 12:08:06 -0800 <timkaine> We authorized $700 million in student loan forgiveness for public servants like firefighters, teachers, and nurses.   Now we’re learning that fewer than 300 people have actually received it.   What is going on?? This administration is maddening.  https://t.co/KKtl5oGtCf
1113483658558676992 2019-04-03 09:49:26 -0800 <timkaine> Puerto Rico is part of the United States, period. And just like Americans in Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia, Puerto Ricans need disaster relief support. We want to treat American citizens all the same—and Republicans ought to want that too.
1113446833295187968 2019-04-03 07:23:06 -0800 <timkaine> Say it with me, folks: More options, lower costs!  We know what people want when it comes to health care. I’ve heard it time and time again. With Medicare-X, we can do it.  https://t.co/9iPdLCxcgY
1113167819884179457 2019-04-02 12:54:24 -0800 <timkaine> We absolutely have to work harder for fair pay for all women. That work includes passing the Paycheck Fairness Act ASAP — when we do, wages will be more transparent, and companies won't be able to punish those who fight against gender-based pay discrimination.
1113167818500059137 2019-04-02 12:54:24 -0800 <timkaine> Today is #EqualPayDay, marking how long into the year women, on average, need to work in order to earn what men earned last year. For black women, Equal Pay Day isn't until August 22. For Latinas, Equal Pay Day is November 20. Imagine how this disparity adds up over a lifetime.
1113116313080213504 2019-04-02 09:29:44 -0800 <timkaine> While Trump focuses on taking health care away from millions of Americans, we’re focused on making health care more accessible and affordable. Medicare-X is a way for people to get the care they need, at a cost they can handle.
1113116311729704960 2019-04-02 09:29:44 -0800 <timkaine> Medicare-X is built on the existing Medicare framework and it includes the critical health benefits established in the ACA, like maternity care and mental health services, while also ensuring access to affordable prescription drugs.
1113116309838065664 2019-04-02 09:29:43 -0800 <timkaine> Today @MichaelBennet and I are really proud to introduce Medicare-X, a public health care plan that brings down premiums and creates more options for folks who need coverage. The ACA was a great start — but too many Americans still can’t afford care.
1112200309546340353 2019-03-30 20:49:52 -0800 <timkaine> GO HOOS!
1111762138123640832 2019-03-29 15:48:43 -0800 <timkaine> Another day, another attack on women’s health from this administration. This drastic action threatens access to health care for women across Virginia.
1110527845154127874 2019-03-26 06:04:05 -0800 <timkaine> Striking down the Affordable Care Act = taking health care away from millions of American families.   A lot of what this President does is bewildering, but denying basic health care to your own people is just plain heartless.

1109947612969472001 2019-03-24 15:38:27 -0800 <timkaine> America needs to see full Mueller report.  All should be thankful for a professional who did his job thoroughly while under constant attack by the President.  He spent 2 years writing this report—Trump’s AG spent 2 days reviewing it. I, for one, would like to see it for myself.
1109207324453941249 2019-03-22 14:36:48 -0800 <timkaine> Release the full report. Let the findings be out there for all to see. The American people deserve it. Our democracy deserves it.
1108764916616437761 2019-03-21 09:18:50 -0800 <timkaine> @BarackObama Virginia swings blue in both 08 and 12 and we can’t even get a final four nod??
1108744483477307392 2019-03-21 07:57:38 -0800 <timkaine> Wahoowa!  https://t.co/0fNqDQaBls
1108507123300950018 2019-03-20 16:14:27 -0800 <timkaine> 16 years ago this week, the Iraq War began.   What followed was years upon years of devastating loss of life.  Today, Iraq is a partner in our fight against terror. So why does the war authorization remain in place?  We need to repeal it. We should not be a nation at endless war.
1108499856644018177 2019-03-20 15:45:35 -0800 <timkaine> And as we mark the new year, I call on the Iranian government to release all Americans wrongfully imprisoned on groundless charges so they can come home and reunite with their loved ones.
1108499855213776897 2019-03-20 15:45:35 -0800 <timkaine> Nowruz Pirooz! Wishing everyone in Virginia and across the world celebrating the beginning of spring a happy new year.
1108472795552456704 2019-03-20 13:58:03 -0800 <timkaine> I always say with this President—it's not surprising, but it's shocking. Bashing John McCain is beyond shocking. It's disgraceful. John loved a fight, but he also put his love for his country over anything else, especially partisan politics. We should honor him by doing the same.
1108054809914032128 2019-03-19 10:17:08 -0800 <timkaine> Wow. I am positively shocked that this Administration would act in contradiction of earlier statements.  https://t.co/UbfYnzO6Ld
1108020048139075584 2019-03-19 07:59:00 -0800 <timkaine> When the President is shouting dangerous rhetoric like this into the global microphone of Twitter, can we even be surprised that he continues to turn a blind eye to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?   Journalists are are a vital part of protecting our democracy, now more than ever.  https://t.co/gBcadmlUKs
1107782989033943042 2019-03-18 16:17:00 -0800 <timkaine> That list includes military training centers in Virginia, a plant to prevent water contamination at Camp Lejeune, a cybersecurity facility in Georgia. I hope my colleagues in Congress will take a serious look at this and then vote to OVERRIDE the President’s veto.
1107782985208729600 2019-03-18 16:16:59 -0800 <timkaine> I was going to tweet out each of the military construction projects that are at risk of losing funding in order for President Trump to build his border wall.   Then I got the list.   I think you’ll see why that isn’t feasible:  https://t.co/VNXwbQSdgJ
1107681223697227776 2019-03-18 09:32:38 -0800 <timkaine> News of a potential terror attack in the Netherlands causes great concern – know that we in the U.S. are praying for safety in Utrecht, swift recovery for those injured, and comfort for all who have been affected.
1107466733240102912 2019-03-17 19:20:19 -0800 <timkaine> FIVE teams from VA in the NCAA tourney‼️ Pretty cool. Cheering on all!
1107372381780275200 2019-03-17 13:05:24 -0800 <timkaine> Muchísimas gracias to the many kind people I met this weekend at the Colombian-Venezuelan border. You welcomed me, talked with me, and showed me what you’re going through. I’m going to do everything I can to support peace, liberty, and democracy in Venezuela.  https://t.co/cS4Zt03rKg
1107336574184894466 2019-03-17 10:43:07 -0800 <timkaine> You might have read about the electrical blackouts in Venezuela. What I saw this weekend is that it’s not just a power blackout – it’s a human rights blackout, a justice blackout.   The U.S. must work to enlighten this dark situation and support venezolanos who are suffering.  https://t.co/OKCULuy1Uj
1107004145670803456 2019-03-16 12:42:10 -0800 <timkaine> I came to the Colombian-Venezuelan border this weekend to better understand the reality on the ground, so I can be a stronger advocate for the people of Venezuela back in Washington.  Just after 4pm, I’ll be talking with @CNN LIVE from the border about what I’ve learned so far.
1106991804476477440 2019-03-16 11:53:07 -0800 <timkaine> Photos from my afternoon: I visited a soup kitchen at the Colombian-Venezuelan border to talk with people who are impacted by the ongoing crisis here.  The U.S. supports the people of Venezuela, and we’re going to keep working to provide much-needed humanitarian aid.  https://t.co/Jf7Ugh1s1r
1106537577123889152 2019-03-15 05:48:11 -0800 <timkaine> Absolutely heartbreaking news out of New Zealand. My deepest sympathies are with those who have lost a loved one following these senseless acts of evil at places of worship.   We all must stand together in condemning hate and bigotry across the globe.
1106269862815547392 2019-03-14 12:04:23 -0800 <timkaine> Congress is coming together today to stand up to this presidential power grab and say: Actually, Mr. President, you can't just raid the Pentagon's budget in order to pay for your vanity project!
1106269859850133504 2019-03-14 12:04:22 -0800 <timkaine> The President plans to cannibalize the Pentagon's budget to the tune of 6.1 billion dollars — dollars that we need to pay for things like getting military housing up to acceptable standards! — and once he taps that spigot, who's to say when it stops?
1106269857404895232 2019-03-14 12:04:22 -0800 <timkaine> These are the facts:  1. Military leaders have told us point blank there is no military emergency at the border.  2. President Trump is unhappy that Congress told him he couldn't have billions of dollars to build a wall. 3. So now, he's staging a power grab to get what he wants.
1105591620777492481 2019-03-12 15:09:17 -0800 <timkaine> Tomorrow I will vote once again to END United States involvement in Yemen.  Not only has support for this war *not* been authorized by Congress, its impact has been nothing short of disastrous for the people of Yemen. We should have no part in this.

1104003775046533120 2019-03-08 04:59:46 -0800 <timkaine> President Trump wants to pull 6 billion dollars from the Pentagon budget to build his wall, even as our military housing is rife with serious safety hazards and desperately needs those construction funds. Come on.  https://t.co/WLf0rsPRpd
1103323855513374721 2019-03-06 07:58:00 -0800 <timkaine> It’s been 17 years since Congress authorized the Iraq War, and 28 since the Gulf War. Today, I introduced a bill to repeal those AUMFs—we need not be a nation at permanent war, and we cannot risk future abuse of these authorizations by the President.   https://t.co/HC7zaryam1
1103137653594222592 2019-03-05 19:38:06 -0800 <timkaine> What Virginia resident Aziza Al-Youssef has endured in a Riyadh prison over the past nearly 300 days is deeply disturbing. She must be released—as must all unjustly detained women’s right activists in Saudi Arabia. @GerryConnolly and I demand answers.  https://t.co/IHbMXHLKVq
1101169154034421760 2019-02-28 09:15:59 -0800 <timkaine> Trump says Kim Jong Un didn’t know about brutalization of VA student Otto Warmbier. MBS had no knowledge of VA resident Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. Oh, and Putin had nothing to do with 2016 election interference... Why does he keep sticking up for dictators over his own people??
1100524155152277505 2019-02-26 14:32:59 -0800 <timkaine> President Trump continues to praise Kim Jong Un despite zero evidence of denuclearization from North Korea in the entire year since the last summit. Before he heaps on more, we ought to see something in return.
1100489648579792896 2019-02-26 12:15:52 -0800 <timkaine> How many more pipe-bombers, terrorists with kill lists, pizza parlor conspirators and Synagogue shooters will there be before this President tones down his rhetoric of hate, violence and lies?
1100489646621057024 2019-02-26 12:15:52 -0800 <timkaine> This language from the President is a) a lie (Congress overwhelmingly passed a ban on infanticide 17 years ago that is still on the books) and b) essentially an incitement to violence against Democrats.  https://t.co/wtK0Lrlab9
1100450941856288769 2019-02-26 09:42:04 -0800 <timkaine> @vademocrats Thanks team. But you know, I just call them “jokes.”
1099700773968056322 2019-02-24 08:01:10 -0800 <timkaine> With the painful controversies in Virginia, we find ourselves confronting again what it mean that our Commonwealth was the capital of a Confederacy dedicated to white supremacy. To move forward, we must look honestly at our history and today’s injustices.  https://t.co/BQ8AlUqSxX
1099040457714221056 2019-02-22 12:17:18 -0800 <timkaine> It’s not that complicated. A judge has confirmed what we’ve known for some time—that federal prosecutors under then-Attorney Alex Acosta violated survivors’ rights when giving a serial sexual abuser “the deal of a lifetime.” He never should have been confirmed as Labor Secretary.
1098236968574558209 2019-02-20 07:04:32 -0800 <timkaine> This week Virginia has the chance to be the 38th and final state needed to ratify the ERA. It’s far past time for us to show women around the world that we stand for their rights—and how fitting that it could be this VA legislature with a record number of women that gets it done!
1097301099000807425 2019-02-17 17:05:43 -0800 <timkaine> Rainy Sunday so made soup for Anne and me. Check this vintage crock pot—at least 35 years old. American technology rocks!  https://t.co/X5JQkhp4if
1096776075626102784 2019-02-16 06:19:28 -0800 <timkaine> Thank goodness Europe is committed to diplomacy and peace. US abandonment of Iran deal was idiotic and driven by Trump’s envy of Obama.   The professionals—Secretary Mattis, General Dunford—urged Trump to stay in.  https://t.co/QeHPUoJBJV
1096437822800711681 2019-02-15 07:55:22 -0800 <timkaine> -Removing lead from military housing -Making overseas bases safer  -Upgrading hospitals that treat wounded troops  These are the types of projects military construction funding is supposed to pay for when it isn’t stolen to build a wall that won’t make us safer.
1095373528042520576 2019-02-12 09:26:14 -0800 <timkaine> A year ago this week, 17 families in Parkland experienced the worst day of their lives. We are holding them in our prayers and we also must honor them by taking action—commonsense gun reform can prevent more worst days from becoming reality if we stand up to say enough is enough.
1094083913104982016 2019-02-08 20:01:46 -0800 <timkaine> Lieutenant Governor Fairfax should resign. The allegations against him detail atrocious crimes, and he can no longer effectively serve the Commonwealth. We cannot ever ignore or tolerate sexual assault.
1092961755699933184 2019-02-05 17:42:43 -0800 <timkaine> One of the many reasons why we need to stop all US support for Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen.  https://t.co/zg1Rjdj3a8
1091861295865966593 2019-02-02 16:49:53 -0800 <timkaine> I no longer believe Governor Northam can effectively serve as Governor of Virginia. The events of the past 24 hours have inflicted immense pain and irrevocably broken the trust Virginians must have in their leaders. He should step down and allow the Commonwealth to begin healing.
1091351588034281472 2019-02-01 07:04:29 -0800 <timkaine> Today is @AnneHolton's birthday, and boy am I glad she was born!! Some fun pix over the years — with the best yet to come! Happy birthday, Anne🎂🎊  https://t.co/VaTfm34XvN
1090726896067858433 2019-01-30 13:42:11 -0800 <timkaine> My End Shutdowns Act does exactly what it says: ends shutdowns. We cannot keep putting our federal workers and the American public through this!
1090686853785837568 2019-01-30 11:03:04 -0800 <timkaine> This should be obvious: Women deserve equal pay! Yet they still only make 80 cents to every dollar paid to men, and the disparity is even worse for women of color.  Today @PattyMurray, @MarkWarner and I are re-introducing the Paycheck Fairness Act to try to close that gap.
1089604025258074117 2019-01-27 11:20:18 -0800 <timkaine> On #HolocaustMemorialDay, we remember the millions killed, including 6 million Jews. Not just to honor them, but also to ensure that atrocities in our history are never repeated. These crimes against humanity are unspeakable—but speak of them we must, in order to learn from them.
1089324731826876417 2019-01-26 16:50:29 -0800 <timkaine> Make no mistake, federal employees standing strong—especially our air safety professionals—was key to ending the shutdown. We owe an apology and thanks to all who suffered through the #TrumpShutdown. And to think he said he was “proud” to do it!   You can’t close the USA.
1088938033741746177 2019-01-25 15:13:53 -0800 <timkaine> @13DavidAlan Hey David - Congress passed our bill to pay federal employees back and I’ve introduced one to do the same for federal contractors.
1088909746361561089 2019-01-25 13:21:29 -0800 <timkaine> Millions of Americans can breathe again. Like them, I'm relieved. But both parties must now work to reach a long-term compromise—and ensure no one can ever again hold public servants hostage by using a government shutdown as a negotiating tactic. Never. Again.
1088821557407944705 2019-01-25 07:31:03 -0800 <timkaine> Why is our country treating people like this? Oh, right — because the president can’t get his way.
1088808488791429125 2019-01-25 06:39:07 -0800 <timkaine> Today is the second missed paycheck for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. There’s no quippy tweet that can address this. We’re facing a mind-boggling humanitarian disaster, and it’s entirely man-made.
1088543461832298498 2019-01-24 13:06:00 -0800 <timkaine> I just voted to end the shutdown and provide relief to millions of Americans. Deeply disappointed more of my Republican colleagues didn’t support reopening government as we negotiate a compromise. We *must* stay in session this weekend so both parties can work on a path forward.
1088424790321442821 2019-01-24 05:14:26 -0800 <timkaine> Mr. President: A novel idea for you... End the shutdown today and give the speech as scheduled!
1088142941519052801 2019-01-23 10:34:28 -0800 <timkaine> Just to be clear: I will keep trying to reopen the government until I'm blue in the face. (And then some.)
1088100155532951552 2019-01-23 07:44:27 -0800 <timkaine> Shutting down the government is not a negotiating tool.   People's lives are not leverage.   If we give in to that kind of tactic, using Americans' lives and livelihoods as leverage, we can be sure the president will turn to it again and again—every time he doesn't get his way.
1087444108094914560 2019-01-21 12:17:33 -0800 <timkaine> Spoken 55 years ago, but still as meaningful as the day Dr. King said those words. While he is no longer with us, his legacy, his example, and his wisdom continue to this very day.
1087444106022928386 2019-01-21 12:17:33 -0800 <timkaine> So right now let's look back at some words of his that are particularly resonant today. In September of 1964, he spoke near the Berlin Wall—a wall built smack in the center of Berlin, separating west from east to keep people divided from one another. This is what he said:  https://t.co/9smMXRgxLh
1087444105167294465 2019-01-21 12:17:33 -0800 <timkaine> If you turn on the TV right now, you're more likely to hear the words “wall” or “shutdown” than “justice” or “dream.” On a day when we ought to be reflecting about the dreams Dr. King had, we’re instead talking about the 31st day of shutdown and the hatred that compels it.
1087375162771718144 2019-01-21 07:43:35 -0800 <timkaine> There is no progress on North Korea denuclearization unless and until the country discloses its sites. Without that, they are not serious and we should not pretend they are.
1086275842576134144 2019-01-18 06:55:17 -0800 <timkaine> I took a highlighter to Bill Barr's memo to the DOJ from June 2018. Pretty interesting stuff.  https://t.co/YIj9ROImc9
1086025996980113415 2019-01-17 14:22:29 -0800 <timkaine> Day 27: I just directly requested passage of a bill to reopen the government. Senator McConnell refused.   Impossible to overstate exactly how ridiculous and offensive — not to mention unnecessary — this continuing shutdown is.
1085631586744393729 2019-01-16 12:15:14 -0800 <timkaine> I gotta say, trying to take a long weekend off while our people all around the country are suffering... it's intolerable. You want to go home? Vote!   We can reopen the government *right now* and fix this mess.
1085274893741146119 2019-01-15 12:37:52 -0800 <timkaine> Virginia would be the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment - the deciding number to finally add this to the Constitution. Today, we're one step closer!   On to the House - let's declare once and for all that women deserve full equality in our country!
1085232454821126144 2019-01-15 09:49:14 -0800 <timkaine> I said it last week and I’ll say it again: The Senate must not recess without reopening the government. Period.
1084567615002107904 2019-01-13 13:47:24 -0800 <timkaine> By keeping the government shut down, with law enforcement and others unpaid, Trump is making us less safe.  https://t.co/wEbGmjDEpz
1083754460743127040 2019-01-11 07:56:13 -0800 <timkaine> It should be payday for hundreds of thousands of federal workers. But thanks to Trump, many are actually getting pay stubs like this.  He's treating them like the countless contractors he stiffed throughout his business career.  https://t.co/ww06FBjzrT
1083449311269138435 2019-01-10 11:43:39 -0800 <timkaine> Why would the Senate leave town this weekend before voting to reopen the government?! Countless federal workers aren't being paid. People are worrying about how to pay bills. Congress could act now to fix it if Mitch McConnell would just take up a bill. Let's stay here and do it!
1082803399211565056 2019-01-08 16:57:02 -0800 <timkaine> Mitch McConnell is refusing to allow Senators to vote to end this stupid shutdown. People are sick of these political games. Congress should stop covering for the president. Our Senate effort tonight to push to reopen government says enough is enough.  Will Sen. McConnell listen?
1082749626309099521 2019-01-08 13:23:22 -0800 <timkaine> 🚨It's a special Election Day in Virginia, and polls are open in #SD33 until 7 PM. If you're in the 33rd District, go vote for @JenniferBoysko so Dems can #KeepSD33! Jennifer is a bold leader who will keep making progress on health care, the economy, and so much more. Go VOTE!
1082324742760251392 2019-01-07 09:15:01 -0800 <timkaine> The Senate should vote on nothing else until we vote to reopen the government. Period. This shutdown is squeezing the finances of so many Americans, including thousands of federal workers who live in Virginia. As leaders, we can’t just whistle past the graveyard of this crisis.
1081325206503940104 2019-01-04 15:03:13 -0800 <timkaine> This nation – the greatest nation on earth – looks like a laughingstock because the President’s fragile ego is leading him to shut everything down to get his way. It’s a temper tantrum more befitting a playpen than the Oval Office.
1081282761615441920 2019-01-04 12:14:34 -0800 <timkaine> We’ve gone from Mexico paying for the wall to threatening thousands of federal workers that they may be furloughed or work without pay for YEARS if taxpayers don’t pay for the wall.
